This section explains the basic Doomsday piles that attempt to end
the game directly with a lethal Tendrils of Agony. Fortunately, these piles will also be the piles that you will execute 
most frequently and win most of your games with.

However, there will be 
times where you will have to build Chain of Vapor piles to bounce a 
Leyline of Sanctity while going off, or build up to 20 storm with Time Spiral or 
double-Doomsday pile, or build a pile that plays around artifact destruction, 
or even optimize for the highest probability of being successful against 
a Surgical Extraction in your opponent's hand.

Before this becomes too intimidating, let's first consider the most 
simple Doomsday piles. And since this is the starting point for reading 
about Doomsday piles in general, we will first explain a bit about the notation 
that we use when writing down piles. 

## Notation

List of cardname abbreviations:

| Shorthand | Cardname |
| --------- | ---- |
| IU | Ideas Unbound |
| SDT | Sensei's Divining Top |
| LED | Lion's Eye Diamond |
| GP | Gitaxian Probe |
| BW | Burning Wish |
| ToA | Tendrils of Agony |
| BS | Brainstorm |
| P | Ponder |
| LP | Lotus Petal |
| DD | Doomsday |
| DR | Dark Ritual |
| CoV | Chain of Vapor |
| IC | Infernal Contract |
| TSP | Time Spiral |
| LM | Laboratory Maniac |
| SI | Shelldock Isle |
| EM | Emrakul, the Aeons Torn |

Mana costs are represented as follows:  
W White - U Blue - B Black - R Red - G Green  
1 one generic mana  
BBB means three black mana  
1UU means two blue mana and one generic mana

Consider the following example of a Doomsday pile in this notation:
```
-> IU, LED, GP, LED, BW(ToA) BBB+1UU (6) 8 Storm
```
This means that IU is the top card and BW is the bottom card. BBB+1UU 
represents the mana cost, (6) is the converted mana cost. 8 Storm 
represents the amount of storm that executing this pile will generate, 
this includes the Doomsday you've cast to create this pile as well as 
the Tendrils of Agony (including the non-copy original spell) at the end 
of the pile. The original Tendrils is included for simplicity, because 
we simply count to ten if we want to cause 20 lifeloss. I will 
frequently leave out the wishtarget for BW at the end of the pile, 
because it is obvious that it is used for Tendrils of Agony.

## Basic Doomsday Piles

The Doomsday piles that we will explain here are all based on using 
Ideas Unbound as the big draw spell. We will first consider the single 
cantrip piles, followed by the double cantrip piles.

### Single cantrip piles

There are basically two variants to this pile. You either have a spell 
that draws a single card in hand ready to cast or an Sensei's Divining 
Top in play.

SDT in play:
1. cast Doomsday build: -> IU, LED, GP, LED, BW(ToA)
2. tap SDT, draw&cast IU, draw SDT, LED, GP
3. cast SDT
4. cast LED
5. cast GP, draw LED
6. cast LED, sacrifice both LEDs for RRR+BBB
7. tap SDT, draw&cast BW, wish for ToA
8. cast ToA

This pile has cost you BBB+1UU and 2 life and results in 8 storm, that 
is 16 lifeloss. Note that 1UU is often paid for by a single Lion's Eye 
Diamond. With a Dark Ritual and a Lion's Eye Diamond preceding the 
Doomsday you already generate enough storm to cause 20 lifeloss. If you 
are low on life you can build -> IU, LED, LED, BW, X, where X can be any 
card. You can also use this pile to wish for Empty the Warrens instead 
of Tendrils of Agony, as you will draw SDT and then X you will have two 
turns to attack.

GP in hand:
1. cast Doomsday build: -> IU, LED, GP, LED, BW(ToA)
2. cast GP, draw IU
2. cast IU, draw LED, GP, LED
3. cast LED
4. cast LED
5. hold priority, cast GP, sacrifice both LEDs in response for RRR+BBB, pass priority, draw BW
7. cast BW, wish for ToA
8. cast ToA

This pile has cost you BBB+UU and 2 life and results in 8 storm, that is 
16 lifeloss. A Brainstorm or Ponder instead of Gitaxian Probe also works 
for an additional U, the same when you're low on life.

### Double cantrip piles

SDT in play + GP in hand:
1. cast Doomsday build: -> LED, IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)
2. cast GP, draw LED
3. cast LED, sacrifice LED for UUU
4. tap SDT, draw&cast IU, draw SDT, LED, LED
5. cast SDT
6. cast LED
7. cast LED, sacrifice both LEDs for RRR+BBB
8. tap SDT, draw&cast BW, wish for ToA
9. cast ToA

This pile has cost you only BBB and 2 life and results in 9 storm, that 
is 18 lifeloss. This pile is very efficient when it comes to mana, 
because the with SDT an Ideas Unbound pile only uses 4 cards. Therefore 
you can put an additional cantrip to use and basically transform it into 
any card you want through Doomsday. In this case we turn our extra 
Gitaxian Probe into a Lion's Eye Diamond, which then pays for the rest 
of the pile. Again, other cantrips like Brainstorm or Ponder also work 
at the increased cost of U.

Unfortunately, using 2 SDT's is not as cost efficient. The problem is 
that a 2nd SDT would also place itself on top of your library. One 
solution is to not replay the SDT with which you draw IU and use the 
second SDT to draw BW, lowering the mana cost of that pile from BBB+1UU 
to BBB+UU, but also produces 1 less storm.

2x GP in hand:
1. cast Doomsday build: -> LED, IU, LP, LED, BW(ToA)
2. cast GP, draw LED
3. cast LED
4. hold priority, cast GP, sacrifice LED for UUU, pass priority, draw IU
5. cast IU, draw LP, LED, BW(ToA)
6. cast LP, crack for R
7. cast LED
8. hold priority, cast BW, sacrifice LED in reponse for BBB, pass priority, wish for ToA
9. cast ToA

This pile is also quite efficient at BBB+1 and 4 life for 9 storm. It's 
a bit more uncommon than the others listed here, but when you go for 
this pile it's probably as soon as turn 1 or 2. Not using Gitaxian 
Probe, but Ponder or Brainstorm instead increases the mana cost with U 
for each GP replaced.

## Variations

That's it for the basic and most common piles. There are many variations 
of each pile and it doesn't really make sense to list them all. For 
example, for the SDT + GP pile, you can also use SDT to draw the 1st LED 
and then use GP to draw the SDT and replay it. This increases the cost 
of the pile by 1 but also increases the stormcount by 1. What if you 
already have Ideas Unbound in hand? You can build -> SDT, LED, GP, LED, 
BW, similarly to when you've used SDT to draw IU after Doomsday, but 
building -> LED, LED, GP, GP, BW is 1 mana cheaper yet 2 life more 
expensive.

As for the other piles out there, there are countless piles that use 
Brainstorm to draw some cards and put some other cards back. This 
particular trick allows you to exchange cards in hand with cards that 
you've tutored up with Doomsday. As you can imagine this results in a 
large number of combinations of Brainstorm + some other cards in hand 
that enable different Doomsday piles for different mana costs and storm 
counts.

## Get Started

You now have sufficient information to start practicing! Just take a 
proven decklist and start goldfishing trying to figure out what piles to 
build and how to execute them. There are several documents available 
that list Doomsday piles which you can use to get to know more piles. 
These are very important tools when learning to how play the deck. See 
the pile document 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/edit?id=1lpiu0whxJeq52LjwEE8sH1DROsHPAARulB6f7dzqwXM&pli=1).
