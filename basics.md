# The Basics

This section explains the basic Doomsday piles that attempt to end the game directly with a lethal Tendrils of Agony. 
Fortunately, these piles will also be the piles that you will execute most frequently and likely win most of your 
games with.

There will however, be times where you will build piles that win with Laboratory Maniac, or build up a higher storm 
count with a Time Spiral or double-Doomsday pile, or build a pile that plays around Pyroblast on one of your draw 
spells, or even optimize for the highest probability of being successful against a Surgical Extraction in your 
opponent's hand.

Before this becomes too intimidating, let's first consider the most 
simple Doomsday piles. And since this is the starting point for reading 
about Doomsday piles in general, we will first explain a bit about the notation 
that we use when writing down piles. 

## Notation

| Shorthand | Cardname |
| --------- | ---- |
| TW | Three Wishes |
| AoI | Act on Impulse |
| IU | Ideas Unbound |
| LED | Lion's Eye Diamond |
| GP | Gitaxian Probe |
| BW | Burning Wish |
| ToA | Tendrils of Agony |
| LM | Laboratory Maniac |
| BS | Brainstorm |
| P | Ponder |
| LP | Lotus Petal |
| DD | Doomsday |
| DR | Dark Ritual |
| IC | Infernal Contract |
| CB | Conjurer's Bauble |

Mana costs are represented as follows:  
W White - U Blue - B Black - R Red - G Green  
1 one generic mana  
BBB means three black mana  
1UU means two blue mana and one generic mana   
X means a variable amount of generic mana

Consider the following example of a Doomsday pile in this notation:
```
-> IU, LED, GP, LED, BW(ToA) BBB+1UU (6) 8 Storm
```
This means that IU is the top card and BW is the bottom card. BBB+1UU 
represents the mana cost, (6) is the total converted mana cost required
to complete the pile. 8 Storm represents the amount of storm that executing
this pile will generate, this includes the Doomsday you've cast to create
this pile as well as the Tendrils of Agony (including the non-copy original 
spell) at the end of the pile. The original Tendrils is included for 
simplicity, because we simply count to ten if we want to cause 20 lifeloss. 
I will frequently leave out the wish target for BW at the end of the pile, 
because it is obvious that it is used for Tendrils of Agony.

## Basic Doomsday Piles

The Doomsday piles that we will explain here are all based on using either
Ideas Unbound or Three Wishes as the big draw spell. We will first consider the single 
cantrip piles, followed by the double cantrip piles.

There are some key rules you can use to help remember things like storm count.
If the intended pile is meant to win without passing the turn then you always have
1 storm to begin with from Doomsday itself. Additionally if you plan on casting all 
cards used in the Doomsday pile then you get to add 5 storm from that. Breaking down 
the cards sets of pre-pile, pile and wish targets helps the mind easily compute what
storm count you will end up with a certain line of play.

### Single cantrip piles

There are basically two variants to this pile. You either have a spell 
that draws a single card in hand ready to cast, or a 
Conjurer's Bauble in play. For the moment, the difference does not 
really matter and we'll just assume that you have a GP in hand.

*Ideas Unbound*

GP in hand:
1. Cast Doomsday build: -> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
2. Cast GP, draw IU
3. Cast IU, draw LED, LED, GP
4. Cast LED
5. Cast LED
6. Cast GP, hold priority, sacrifice LEDs for BBB+RRR, pass priority, draw BW
7. Cast BW, get ToA from sideboard
8. Cast ToA

This pile has cost you BBB+UU and 4 life and results in 8 storm, that 
is 16 lifeloss. Note that UU is often paid for by a Lion's Eye 
Diamond. With a Dark Ritual (to cast Doomsday) and a Lion's Eye Diamond preceding the 
Doomsday you already generate enough storm to cause 20 lifeloss. If you 
are low on life you'll need more mana to cast GP for mana instead of life.

As for the remarks about priority in step 6, It's best to announce 
that you would like to hold priority when casting the next spell, 
before you actually announce which spell that is. This way there can 
be no discussion about that you waited too long between announcing the 
spell and stating that you want to hold priority after casting it. 
This may be a bit overly cautious, but there's no harm and in this way 
you can avoid discussions during tournament play.

*Three Wishes*

GP in hand:
1. cast Doomsday build: -> TW, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
2. cast GP, draw TW
3. cast TW, exile LED, LED, GP
4. cast LED, sacrifice it for BBB
5. cast LED, sacrifice if for RRR
6. cast GP, draw BW
7. cast BW, get ToA from sideboard
8. cast ToA

This pile costs BBB+1UU and 4 life and results in 8 storm, which is 16 
lifeloss. Like with Ideas Unbound, the mana cost for the draw spell 
(1UU) can be - and often is - paid for by a Lion's Eye Diamond in 
response to the first GP. The most important difference is that Three 
Wishes not actually draws but exiles the cards. This means that 
Lion's Eye Diamond's activation cost will not affect your ability to 
cast the cards 'drawn' with Three Wishes. If you are low on life can 
also build -> TW, LED, LED, BW, X and directly 'draw' Burning Wish 
with Three Wishes, this will produce once less storm.


### Double cantrip piles

*Ideas Unbound*

2x GP in hand:
1. cast Doomsday build: -> LED, IU, LP, LED, BW(ToA)
2. cast GP, draw LED
3. cast LED
4. hold priority, cast GP, sacrifice LED for UUU, draw IU
5. cast IU, draw LP, LED, BW
6. cast LP, crack for R
7. cast LED
8. hold priority, cast BW, sacrifice LED for BBB, wish for ToA
9. cast ToA

This pile has cost only BBB+1 and 4 life to execute and results in 9 
storm, which is 18 lifeloss. This pile is quite efficient when it comes 
to mana. We use the additional cantrip to draw a Lion's Eye Diamond 
before executing the rest of the pile and use that Lion's Eye Diamond 
to pay for much of the rest of the pile. We basically turn our 
additional Gitaxian Probe into a Lion's Eye Diamond with Doomsday.

One difficulty with this pile is that Ideas Unbound actually draws 
Burning Wish before we can sacrifice the second Lion's Eye Diamond in the 
pile to produce red mana. Therefore, one of the Lion's Eye 
Diamonds in the pile is replaced with a Lotus Petal, which together 
with one blue mana left from the first Lion's Eye Diamond pays for the 
Burning Wish. The second Lion's Eye Diamond is sacrificed for three black 
mana and pays for all but 1 mana of Tendrils of Agony.

*Three Wishes*

2x GP in hand:
1. cast Doomsday build: -> LED, TW, LED, LED, BW
2. cast GP, draw LED
3. cast LED
4. hold priority, cast GP, sacrifice LED for UUU, draw TW
5. cast TW, exile LED, LED, BW(ToA)
6. cast LED, sacrifice LED for BBB
7. cast LED, sacrifice LED for RRR
8. cast BW, wish for ToA
9. cast ToA

This pile is very efficient at BBB and 4 life for 9 storm. The key 
idea is that, strictly speaking we only needed TW, LED, LED, BW in our 
single cantrip pile. Meaning that if we shift this 4 card pile to the 
bottom, we can put any card on top. In this case we put a Lion's Eye 
Diamond on top, which we draw with Gitaxian Probe. The Lion's Eye 
Diamond then pays for the Three Wishes, which exiles the other two 
LEDs and the Burning Wish we need to produce mana and wish for and 
cast Tendrils.


## Variations

That's it for the basic and most common piles that end with Tendrils 
of Agony. There are many variations of each pile and it doesn't really 
make sense to list them all. In each of the above piles you may 
replace Gitaxian Probe with a Ponder, or simply use blue mana to pay 
for it rather than 2 life. Also, since Act on Impulse and Three Wishes 
function very similarly, all piles involving Three Wishes can be 
executed with Act on Impulse all the same, except for a different mana 
cost. The use of Conjurer's Bauble to draw into the piles allows for lower
mana or life costs but does result in less storm being generated during the 
play line.

The most important part of learning how to cast Doomsday, is to think 
how you would like to cast a lethal Tendrils of Agony, and then think 
of the cards you'll need to get there. Doomsday is essentially a 5 
card tutor.

The trick is to try not to think of the specifics too much. Try to break everything
down into resources. The key ones are the cards you hold in hand, the mana available, 
any other cards in play like Conjurer's Bauble and your deck construction. 
As you get more familiar with these factors you can then start to consider
your opponent as a factor and become more experienced in generating piles on
the fly to fit whatever gameplay scenario you might come across.

As for the other piles out there, there are countless piles that use 
Brainstorm to draw some cards and put some other cards back. This 
particular trick allows you to exchange cards in hand with cards that 
you've tutored up with Doomsday. As you can imagine this results in a 
large number of combinations of Brainstorm + some other cards in hand 
that enable different Doomsday piles for different mana costs and storm 
counts.


## Get Started

You now have sufficient information to start practicing! Just take a 
proven decklist and start goldfishing trying to figure out what piles 
to build and how to execute them. There are several documents 
available that list Doomsday piles which you can use to get to know 
more piles. These are very important tools when learning to how play 
the deck. See the [DDFT Pile 
Document](https://github.com/Bennotsi-MTG/ddft-pileDoc/blob/master/README.md).
