There are many reasons why you would want to make more storm and cast 
Tendrils for some insane amount of lifeloss. Situations like these may 
even come up quite frequently in Legacy tournaments: Your opponent may 
be holding a Swords to Plowshares, has attacked with a Batterskull, has 
counters on his Umezawa's Jitte, or has simply gained some life using 
his Scavenging Ooze or what not. In each of these scenarios, it's quite 
likely that you would want to cast Tendrils for more than 10 storm, even 
if it's just to be safe. Now you won't always be able to go for a 
Doomsday-Time Spiral pile, and if you can't resolve a Silence first, 
Time Spiral isn't a very desirable plan against blue decks or people 
that play Mindbreak Trap. In these situations you'd probably want to 
kill using a double-Doomsday pile.

Double-Doomsday piles are piles that build up to another Doomsday being 
cast that turn, to construct a second pile that builds up to a kill with 
a very high storm count.

As a basic requirement in addition to a typical Doomsday win you should 
remember that in general you need to produce 3 additional black mana. 
Sometimes this three additional mana can be either 1UU or BBB, which 
will be written as [1UU/BBB]. However, this additional cost can 
basically always be payed for by mana from Lion's Eye Diamond, so 
generally it's not very hard to produce. Let's take a look at a basic 
double-Doomsday pile:

```
SDT in play:
-> IU, LED, DD, LED, BW BBB+1UU+BBB (9) 11 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)
```

plays out as follows:
1. cast Doomsday build: IU, LED, DD, LED, BW
2. SDT draws IU, cast IU, drawing SDT, LED, DD
3. cast SDT
4. cast LED
5. cast Doomsday, sacrifice LED in response for UUU, building: IU, LED, LED, BW, X
6. SDT draws IU, cast IU, drawing SDT, LED, LED
7. cast SDT
8. cast LED
9. cast LED
10. SDT draws BW, cast BW for ToA
11. cast ToA for 11 Storm

You have to realize that from storm 6 and on it's just a regular pile. 
So the procedure that happened up to the point that you cast the second 
Doomsday has cost you 1UU+BBB to execute, but also produced 1UU, which 
allows you to execute a regular pile afterwards. Theoretically, you 
could keep repeating steps 1 to 5 for each additional 3 black mana you 
may have available.

In terms of cards, you should have a Sensei's Divining Top in play or an 
Ideas Unbound in hand. In case you have Ideas Unbound in hand you can 
replace it with a Sensei's Divining Top as the top card of your pile. 
Note that this brings you in the same state as when using SDT to draw to 
the Ideas Unbound directly after resolving Doomsday.

```
Ideas Unbound:
-> SDT, LED, DD, LED, BW BBB+1UU+BBB (9) 11 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)
```
Other draw effects are also fine, at the additional cost of their own 
casting cost (U or 2 life) and a card, typically a Lion's Eye Diamond. 
This is because we replace one of the Lion's Eye Diamonds in the first 
Doomsday pile with a Sensei's Divining Top. Therefore you need to have 
at least 1 Lion's Eye Diamond outside the cards you search with the 
first Doomsday to be able to put 2 Lion's Eye Diamonds in your second 
Doomsday pile.

```
Gitaxian Probe or Brainstorm or Ponder + Lion's Eye Diamond:
-> IU, SDT, DD, LED, BW BBB+[U/2life]+[1UU/BBB] (6/7) 13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA), X
```
Some minor variations for more storm: (list is not exhaustive)
```
-> IU, SDT, DD, LED, BW BBB+[U/2life]+[U/2life]+[1UU/BBB] (6-8) 14 Storm
-> IU, LED, Ponder/GP, LED, BW(ToA)

-> IU, SDT, DD, LED, ToA BBB+[U/2life]+[1UU/BBB] (6/7) 14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, Ponder/GP, ToA

-> IU, SDT, DD, LED, BW BBB+1UU+[1UU/BBB] (9) 15 Storm
-> Brainstorm, IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)
```

These minor variations for more storm also apply to most piles listed 
below, and in all cases BW could also be a ToA. In order to simplify the 
discussion of piles from now on, I will consider Gitaxian Probe as our 
only draw spell, but in nearly all cases you can simply increase the 
listed cost by U and read Brainstorm or Ponder instead. In the listed 
costs it is assumed you have plenty life to cast the Gitaxian Probes for 
life rather than mana, which is quite the assumption if you plan on 
paying half your life rounded up twice already.

## Using cantrips for cheaper Double-Doomsday Piles

You may have noted from the first double-Doomsday scenario that used 
only Sensei's Divining Top that we did not draw the second LED in the 
first pile. This is because it's not needed, but it also indicates a 
potential for more efficient piles. The question is, can we use 
additional draw effects to also draw that second LED and lower the cost 
of the double-Doomsday pile. The answer is yes:

```
SDT in play + GP:
-> LED, IU, LED, DD, BW BBB+[1UU/BBB] (6) 13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)

2x GP + LED:
-> LED, IU, SDT, DD, BW BBB+[1UU/BBB] (6) 14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)
```
This last pile plays out a bit subtle. As you play it out, you will 
notice that you draw the Burning Wish. That is why you need to wait with 
sacrificing your last LED until you cast Doomsday, only then you 
sacrifice your last LED in response to Doomsday in order to discard 
Burning Wish and have all the cards for your second Doomsday pile in 
your graveyard. You may have noticed that this pile isn't actually 
anything more efficient than the pile that uses just GP + LED. This is 
because the extra draw effect that we use, only results in us drawing 
Burning Wish only to discard it again immediately afterwards. This may 
sound rather silly, but the pile is included here because we will 
discuss some variations on it later.

In the last pile we drew BW only to discard it, which is not very 
efficient. But it also makes you wonder what would happen if we already 
had that Burning Wish in hand, could we then have drawn something else 
and perhaps have lowered the cost of the whole procedure?

```
2x GP + BW:
-> LED, IU, SDT, LED, DD BBB+[1UU/BBB] (6) 14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)
```
So to answer our question, the cost hasn't exactly been reduced but 
we've found another set of cards that enables a double-doomsday 
procedure.

## Double-Doomsday without Sensei's Divining Top

You might wonder whether we can execute a double-Doomsday pile without 
SDT. The answer is yes! But you probably won't ever go for a pile like 
this unless there's a Pithing Needle on Sensei's Divining Top, or your 
Sensei's Divining Tops got hit by a Surgical Extraction, or something 
weird like that.

One option that comes to mind is to replace the SDT that you would 
insert in the first pile with something like Gitaxian Probe to draw into 
the second pile. This what the pile would look like, assuming you had a 
Gitaxian Probe and 2xLED before casting the first Doomsday:
```
-> IU, GP, DD, LED, BW
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```
The first problem that arises is that so far we've always sacrificed a 
LED in response to our second Doomsday. We did this not just to pay for 
the draw spells in the next pile, but also to allow the LED to be 
included in the second pile. If you can't sacrifice LED because you are 
still holding a draw spell, you will have to build your 2nd pile without 
it. Thus, increasing the cost of going in to the double-Doomsday 
procedure with another LED. Note that we already required a LED because 
we did not have SDT. So the whole pile becomes:

```
GP + 2x LED:
-> IU, GP, DD, LED, BW BBB (3) 14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```

Note that all but the first Gitaxian Probe can be payed for by LED mana, 
so the life requirement isn't impossible. If you don't have GP to draw 
into the pile but a Ponder or Brainstorm the cost is only increased by 
U. Two Lion's Eye Diamonds in hand before comboing off is quite a 
requirement, but you can also replace one of those Lion's Eye Diamonds 
with the Burning Wish that you would otherwise have to tutor up with 
Doomsday.

To give you some examples:
```
GP + LED + BW:
-> IU, GP, DD, LED, LED BBB+[1UU/BBB] (6) 13 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)

2x GP + LED + BW:
-> LED, IU, GP, DD, LED BBB (3) 15 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```

## Building Piles as you go

Obviously, there are many more variations and piles than I've listed 
here. For example, you could also consider double-Doomsday Piles where 
you already have the 2nd Doomsday in hand, in that case you may lower 
the requirements for cards in hand by including a LED or SDT in the slot 
of DD in the first pile. The only downside is that you can't use LED to 
pay for the Doomsday that is already in your hand. Unless perhaps you 
plan to use a Brainstorm somewhere in your spell chain to put it back, 
before you draw it again and sacrifice a LED with that draw effect on 
the stack. What I'm trying to say is that once you know what spell chain 
you are going to use to kill your opponent, it doesn't really matter 
anymore how you get there. Your mana, the cards in your hand, and the 
cards that you search for with the first Doomsday is what you have to 
deal with, and together that should result in a Tendrils of Agony for 
some high storm count. That's exactly why many people including myself 
think we should not strive to create a full listing of all possible 
doomsday piles, but rather create a deep understanding of how to combo 
off using Doomsday.

Okay, just a few more:
```
BS + DD:
-> SDT, IU, LED, LED, BW BBB+1U+[1UU/BBB] (8) 14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)

SDT in play + DD:
-> BS, IU, LED, LED, BW BBB+1U+[1UU/BBB] (8) 14 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(ToA)
```
And by now I hope you immediately see that the Doomsday in hand might as 
well have been an Ideas Unbound. Actually, if you have enough blue mana 
to cast Ideas Unbound you can go for piles with even lower requirements. 
Just realize that every card you have in hand is a resource and if you 
are going to discard a card without using it, you're quite likely 
throwing away an opportunity for building a more efficient doomsday 
pile.

## double-Doomsday double-Chain of Vapor piles

It's perhaps a bit of a corner case, at least I haven't been forced to 
pull off any of these in a real game yet. But, the scenario of playing 
against a deck that plays both Leyline of Sanctity and cards that gain 
life, like Swords to Plowshares or Batterskull, or multiple Leylines, is 
not unrealistic in Legacy. This means that at some point you may need to 
bounce one or two permanents and build up a high storm count. If you are 
very fluent with double-Doomsday piles this may seem quite obvious, but 
sometimes just being reminded of the possibility is all you need.

Basically the message is that double-Doomsday piles and Chain of Vapor 
piles are 'fully compatible'. You can start your double-Doomsday pile 
with the familiar Sensei's Divining Top + Chain of Vapor interaction or 
use Chain of Vapor half way through your pile if you can replace some 
other card, typically Lion's Eye Diamond is replaced by simply 
generating more mana pre-Doomsday. You can also reuse the Chain of Vapor 
for your second Doomsday pile. For the second doomsday pile you can 
basically choose from:

```
-> IU, LED, LED, BW, X +0 +0 Storm
-> IU, LED, CoV, LED, BW +1U +4 Storm
-> IU, LED, CoV, LED, ToA +U +2 Storm
```
Unfortunately, double-Doomsday Chain of Vapor piles do not allow us to 
lower the cost of Chain of Vapor piles when you have Sensei's Divining 
Top in play and Gitaxian Probe in hand. In which case, you can not use 
Gitaxian Probe to somehow lower the mana cost of the Chain of Vapor 
pile.
