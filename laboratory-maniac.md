Just to be very clear on the purpose of this section: This does not 
consider the use of Mental Note or Unearth or any other dead cards that 
are vulnerable to graveyard hate. We use Laboratory Maniac together with 
the cards that we are already playing.

Laboratory Maniac serves as an alternative way to win within Doomsday 
storm combo. It is a win condition that doesn't target the opponent 
(Leyline of Sanctity), doesn't involve casting noncreature spells with 
converted mana cost 4 or greater (Gaddock Teeg), and doesn't care about 
your opponent's life total. Because Laboratory Maniac is a creature and 
needs to be in play when you draw from an empty library, he is 
vulnerable to removal spells like Swords to Plowshares, Lightning Bolt, 
Pyroblast, and Abrupt Decay, which are all Legacy staples. The reason is 
Laboratory Maniac serves as an additional strategy in Doomsday storm 
combo, if you know your opponent is holding up Abrupt Decay, just build 
a Tendrils pile that wins through that. Pyroblast is problematic for any 
Ideas Unbound pile, Laboratory Maniac doesn't change that. Swords to 
Plowshares and Lightning Bolt may be played through if you have 
additional instant-speed draw, for example a 2nd Sensei's Divining Top 
in play or a Chromatic Sphere to win at mana-ability speed.

Playing a 1-off Laboratory Maniac comes with a number of perks:
- Win through any number of Leyline of Sanctity and/or Gaddock Teeg at very little extra cost.
- Win through heavy discard with a number of extremely cheap pass the turn piles.
- Win even if Burning Wish is extracted or named by Meddling Mage.
- Win when you lack the resources to build sufficient storm for a Tendrils kill.

And a couple of downsides:
- Vulnerable to removal
- Pretty dead card when you draw it pre-Doomsday.

## Winning with Laboratory Maniac

Now let's look into what winning with Laboratory Maniac looks like in 
Doomsday storm combo. Assuming you have 1 Laboratory Maniac somewhere in 
your maindeck, the standard piles are:
```
GP in hand:
-> IU, SDT, LED, GP, LM BBB+1UU 4 life

SDT in play:
-> IU, LED, GP, GP, LM BBB+1UU 4 life

SDT in play + GP in hand:
-> LED, IU, GP, LED, LM BBB 4 life

2x GP in hand:
-> LED, IU, SDT, DR, LM BBB+B 4 life
```
Most of these piles speak for themselves. Somehow draw and cast 
Ideas Unbound draw SDT, LED, GP, cast SDT, use GP+LED to draw and cast 
Laboratory Maniac, tap SDT to draw a card and win the game. Or when you 
suspect removal and you have sufficient life left to live another turn, 
you might pass the turn waiting for your next upkeep as the last moment 
for your opponent to cast any removal, to which you can respond with 
SDT, or win in your draw step. In the 2x GP pile float U after casting 
IU, use black to cast Dark Ritual, cast SDT using black mana, cast LM. 
Obviously, add U to the mana cost and subtract 2 life for each GP you 
don't have enough life for or when you have another cantrip instead. 
Many other variations are possible but I'm not going to list all, for 
that see the overview in the pile document.

Like with regular Ideas Unbound piles there is a whole range of very 
cheap piles that use Brainstorm, Gitaxian Probe, Ideas Unbound, and/or 
Laboratory Maniac in hand. Learning all these piles takes some practice 
but may allow for fast wins, although not cheaper than a normal 
Tendrils-based wins.

## Chromatic Sphere

Chromatic Sphere can be used to enable Laboratory Maniac piles even when 
your opponent is holding creature removal.The key idea is to draw your 
entire library and get Chromatic Sphere and Laboratory Maniac in play, 
then with 1 mana floating you activate Chromatic Sphere to win the game 
at mana-ability speed, without your opponent being able to respond. 
Abrupt Decay may still be used on the Chromatic Sphere with Laboratory 
Maniac on the stack, but after that it's too late. The same is true for 
Pyroblast that may still be used on the cantrip that draws into the pile 
or the Ideas Unbound. But the good news is Chromatic Sphere piles do 
play through Swords to Plowshares and/or Lightning Bolt. Playing a 
singleton Chromatic Sphere is not a huge price to pay, because it can 
generally also be used to draw into your Doomsday pile or just cantrip 
while fixing mana colors.

To use Chromatic Sphere inside Doomsday piles that do not use SDT to 
draw into the pile simply replace the SDT in the pile with a Chromatic 
Sphere and use one extra mana to draw from an empty library. Piles that 
use Sensei's Divining Top to draw into the pile can't use Chromatic 
Sphere very effectively.
