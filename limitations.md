# Playing against Surgical Extraction

When people are side-boarding to face Doomsday there is one card that
they so often bring in along with all the discard, counter-magic, 
spheres and such; Surgical Extraction. This card is particularly
annoying as it performs a number of functions against us. It removes
options from our piles that can be very key (commonly LED). It
can take out the namesake card (assuming no BW or after BW into DD)
and worse of all it can cause us to shuffle our perfect five card
piles and make them all but useless.

#Limitations of Our Mind

As can be see above there are a number of ways we can get through the
limitations presented by our own preferences of deck building and of the
constraints our opponents try to enforce upon us. Side boarding correctly
can help mitigate a lot of these issues by presenting answers to the problems
before we go off. We can also use the tools already in our repertoire such
as discard spells, silence effects and suchlike to limits our opponent's 
ability to interact with us.

The key thing to remember if faced with limitations is to not panic. It
doesn't matter if your LEDs are gone, you have alternatives. The surgical in 
the opponent's hand? Negligible. That Pyroblast they have ready for your Three
Wishes? Hah! Just remember there is more than one path to victory and to try
not to fall into the trap of despair that comes from rote learning of piles
only to see them become useless in the face of an untimely Revoker or Chalice
on 0.
