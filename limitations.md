### Playing against Surgical Extraction

When people are side-boarding to face Doomsday there is one card that
they so often bring in along with all the discard, counter-magic, 
spheres and such; Surgical Extraction. This card is particularly
annoying as it performs a number of functions against us. It removes
options from our piles that can be very key (commonly LED). It
can take out the namesake card (assuming no BW or after BW into DD)
and worse of all it can cause us to shuffle our perfect five card
piles and make them all but useless.

There are a couple of ways of beating Surgical. Obviously the use of discard
or Silence can help protect you however sometimes you might be facing an active
Snapcaster with Surgical in the graveyard or something similar. Forcing the
opponent to panic "use it or lose it" is the best way to stop them getting full
value out of it. What they try and use it on in this instance obviously depends
on what is currently targetable in your graveyard. Trying to work out what the 
opponent will go for requires some good observational or psychological skills.  

Say you send a Duress at your opponent in a game 2. You have won the first one 
though a storm kill and they have a Surgical in hand that you have seen with a GP. 
Your graveyard contains: Flooded Strand, Gitaxian Probe, Polluted Delta, Brainstorm,
Ponder. What are they likely to Surgical?    
From my experiences they normally aggressively try to hit Brainstorm. Everyone knows BS
is busted right? What if there was also a Lotus Petal in the graveyard too? Would they 
try and limit your mana choices or still hit the notorious cantrip?

There are some cards that are certainly more obvious targets than others. Doomsday is the
main one followed by Lion's Eye Diamond and Dark Ritual. Depending on your list and what 
the opponent has seen they might also be very tempted to try and get Burning Wish too. 
Very rarely do people aim for your protection spells (Discard or Silence) and though they 
sometimes do they don't often try and hit the other cantrips, Gitaxian Probe is probably the 
most likely candidate to be targeted after Brainstorm.

Another thing you can try and do to play against Surgical pre-combo turn is to 
actually lever advantage from it. Try and use your discard to hit it with an active 
Brainstorm available. In response to their Surgical you can cast it and use the resolving 
Surgical as a shuffle effect. Alternatively you might cast a Brainstorm and fail to find a 
fetchland, you can use any discard available (assuming no big risk to your hand) to then
force the shuffle effect to occur with the tasty BS in the yard as a bait target.

Obviously not everyone plays the same and many will not adhere to the suggestions
written above. You should be able to get a feel yourselves on your own local metagames
and as people play against you more, they will of course improve their judgement on what
to target. In larger events you should be able to get some more mileage out of opponents
misplaying Surgicals as a result of not being used to facing DDFT. 

If they do have a Surgical still and you need to combo off there are some piles or 
circumstances that will facilitate this. 

Example:
```
CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> AoI/TW, LED, LED, GP, BW              BBB+R2    (6)    8 Storm
```

This pile is already touched upon in the <a href="https://github.com/Bennotsi-MTG/DDFT-PileDoc/blob/cb-piles/cb-piles.md">CB article.</a>   
No matter when they play Surgical post DD here, you can respond and negate 
its efficacy.

### Playing with a Chalice of the Void on X

This is a generic title. This section discusses all cards that selectively
lock off a certain CMC cost of a spell. This can include things like Chalice
of the Void, Sanctum Prelate or non-permanent hate such as Spell Snare.
There are some CMC's the deck needs to be able to function, and some that 
are completely optional. Here we shall exaplore in ascending numerical order
the relevancy these cards have against us.

For each value examples will be given on what hate you might face and how to 
get around the listed limiter.

#### 0 Cost spells

In terms of 0 costs spells we have two main ones that are played. Lion's
Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal. Both are incredibly useful mana generating 
resources but neither are required to win. All that it means is more mana 
is needed post DD to get us going. 

Examples:

```
Cantrip in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, BW                  BBB+UUBR    (7)    8 Storm

CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, BW                  BBB+BBR1+X  (7+X)  9+X Storm

CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, ToA                 BBB+B+X     (4+X)  8+X Storm
```

The general concept to remember is that our main method of mana increase 
is DR. This means we need both B to enable the casting of these rituals
and also R available to cast BW at the end. Alternatively if you are aiming for
a LM pile you need U to help cast him. As all our cantrips are not affected we
can still easliy draw into what we need. If you happen to be playing with maindeck
ToA then you don't need to worry about these additional colour requirements but
for most DDFT lists you do.

Further Examples:

```
GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, BW                  BBB+UUBR  (7)  8 Storm

GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, GP, CB, LM                  BBB+UUUB  (7)  2 Life

GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, ToA                 BBB+UUB   (6)  7 Storm

```

#### 1 Cost spells

This is THE classic opener of stompy variants, aggro loam and other 
strategies that aren't concerned with cantripping or similar. The main issue
with this limitation is getting to the point you can cast Doomsday rather 
than the actual going off. Obviously things like running BW along with artifact
hate such as Meltdown can help get around the issue but you may just find you can
go off without it (however unlikely that may be).

The two main points to take is the lack of ability to cast your cantrips and the 
lack of being able to cast things like DR or CB. IC is the preferred draw method here
as it means you get the complete stack rather than IU that leaves you eneding to draw 
an additional card. If you have a CB in play already then there is obviously no issue 
but it is still worth considering.

With these piles you also have to consider you have most likely cast DD off of lands
and LPs. As a result you probably have less mana available therefore pass the turn piles
are a strong consideration.

Example:

```
Pass the turn.
-> BW (IC), LED, LED, LP, BW          BBB+2R   (7)  7 Storm
```

#### 2 Cost spells

This is less likely to be faced in terms of Chalice of the Void but significant in that
it includes playing around Spell Snare, a semi common card in many Ux decks. The main things
that get cut from this is IU and BW. Ideally this means if you are running TW/AoI you
should have no issues generating a simple double cantrip LM pile however if you require a BW
storm kill then you have to get rid of it. You can also ignore the limitation with maindeck
ToA.

As you can see this is already a fairly straightforwards limitation to get around so I won't
include any examples for it.

#### 3+ Cost spells

Congratulations to whomever has cast their Chalice on 4 or more however that is more than
likely not what has happened. Instead it's probably a Sanctum Prelate or Gaddock Teeg on 
the opposing battlefield. Prelate is a little more tricky as that can lock off your 3 spells
(DD, AoI, TW, IC) which can make going off with our namesake spell difficult but not impossible. 
Thankfully Prelate is a 3 drop itself and therefore a little bit slower to come down. 

Teeg is both an easier to set down threat (2 drop and can be got with Green Sun's Zenith) however 
it is also easier to play around. It only really stops two spells commonly run; TS and ToA. Simply
put; just make a basic LM pile and you should be able to win. If not, then removal will have to
come into play. 

### Playing against Revoker naming X

This is a play that you often find versus MUD or Death and Taxes. Unlike Pithing
Needle, Revoker shuts down Lion's Eye Diamond and / or Lotus Petal. One updside 
compared to say, Chalice on 0, is that you can still cast the named cards
allowing generation of storm. You can also get rid of them through both
artifact and creature removal. If not, you can also follow the same tips for 
Chalice on 0 mentioned above. 

### Playing against Red Blasts

Any deck playing Red will likely bring in at least one Red Elemental Blast or
Pyroblast against you. It hits cantrips and therefore has a high number of 
targets. The main trick to getting around these is just not play Blue spells (duh). 
Using BW into AoI/IC or CB to draw into your pilewill negate the R blast into nothing
but a R: +1 Storm effect.

Example:
```
BW (IC) in hand:
-> CB, LED, LED, LP, BW (ToA)          BBB+1BBBR   (8)  8 Storm
```

### Playing against Thalia and other Sphere effects

These are a real headache. 

### Playing against Chains of Mephitospholes

This example of a hate card is pretty narrow but very brutal. Expect
this from decks like Jund variants or Pox-esque decks. The main trick
to this is to limit how many times the words "Draw a card" are used. 
Luckily AoI/TW both avoid this terminology therefore making them
perfect for getting around the issue. You likely will need at least one
draw effect though so make sure to have an excess card available to bin to 
enabling the draw.

Example:
```
BW (AoI)+GP+1 Card in hand:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, X                BBB+1R   (5)  9 Storm
```

If you do have to use IU or similar, you should be fine so long as you have
enough 'dead' cards available to discard.

## Limitations of Our Mind

As can be see above there are a number of ways we can get through the
limitations presented by our own preferences of deck building and of the
constraints our opponents try to enforce upon us. Side boarding correctly
can help mitigate a lot of these issues by presenting answers to the problems
before we go off. We can also use the tools already in our repertoire such
as discard spells, silence effects and suchlike to limits our opponent's 
ability to interact with us.

The key thing to remember if faced with limitations is to not panic. It
doesn't matter if your LEDs are gone, you have alternatives. The Surgical in 
the opponent's hand? Negligible. That Pyroblast they have ready for your Three
Wishes? Hah! Just remember there is more than one path to victory and to try
not to fall into the trap of despair that comes from rote learning of piles
only to see them become useless in the face of an untimely Revoker or Chalice
on 0.

Keep an opoonent mind, stay cool and always have fun.
