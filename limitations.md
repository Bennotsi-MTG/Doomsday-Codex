### Playing against Surgical Extraction

When people are side-boarding to face Doomsday there is one card that
they so often bring in along with all the discard, counter-magic, 
spheres and such; Surgical Extraction. This card is particularly
annoying as it performs a number of functions against us. It removes
options from our piles that can be very key (commonly LED). It
can take out the namesake card (assuming no BW or after BW into DD)
and worse of all it can cause us to shuffle our perfect five card
piles and make them all but useless.

There are a couple of ways of beating Surgical. Obviously the use of discard
or Silence can help protect you however sometimes you might be facing an active
Snapcaster with Surgical in the graveyard or something similar. Forcing the
opponent to panic "use it or lose it" is the best way to stop them getting full
value out of it. What they try and use it on in this instance obviously depends
on what is currently targetable in your graveyard. Trying to work out what the 
opponent will go for requires some good observational or psychological skills.  

Say you send a Duress at your opponent in a game 2. You have won the first one 
though a storm kill and they have a Surgical in hand that you have seen with a GP. 
Your graveyard contains: Flooded Strand, Gitaxian Probe, Polluted Delta, Brainstorm,
Ponder. What are they likely to Surgical?    
From my experiences they normally aggressively try to hit Brainstorm. Everyone knows BS
is busted right? What if there was also a Lotus Petal in the graveyard too? Would they 
try and limit your mana choices or still hit the notorious cantrip?

There are some cards that are certainly more obvious targets than others. Doomsday is the
main one followed by Lion's Eye Diamond and Dark Ritual. Depending on your list and what 
the opponent has seen they might also be very tempted to try and get Burning Wish too. 
Very rarely do people aim for your protection spells (Discard or Silence) and though they 
sometimes do they don't often try and hit the other cantrips, Gitaxian Probe is probably the 
most likely candidate to be targeted after Brainstorm.

Another thing you can try and do to play against Surgical pre-combo turn is to 
actually lever advantage from it. Try and use your discard to hit it with an active 
Brainstorm available. In response to their Surgical you can cast it and use the resolving 
Surgical as a shuffle effect. Alternatively you might cast a Brainstorm and fail to find a 
fetchland, you can use any discard available (assuming no big risk to your hand) to then
force the shuffle effect to occur with the tasty BS in the yard as a bait target.

Obviously not everyone plays the same and many will not adhere to the suggestions
written above. You should be able to get a feel yourselves on your own local metagames
and as people play against you more, they will of course improve their judgement on what
to target. In larger events you should be able to get some more mileage out of opponents
misplaying Surgicals as a result of not being used to facing DDFT. 

If they do have a Surgical still and you need to combo off there are some piles or 
circumstances that will facilitate this. 

Example:
```
CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> AoI/TW, LED, LED, GP, BW              BBB+R2    (6)    8 Storm
```

This pile is already touched upon in the CB article. [LINK PLACEHOLDER].    
No matter when they play Surgical post DD here, you can respond and negate 
its efficacy.

### Playing with a Chalice of the Void on X

This is a generic title. This section discusses all cards that selectively
lock off a certain CMC cost of a spell. This can include things like Chalice
of the Void, Sanctum Prelate or non-permanent hate such as Spell Snare.
There are some CMC's the deck needs to be able to function, and some that 
are completely optional. Here we shall exaplore in ascending numerical order
the relevancy these cards have against us.

#### 0 Cost spells

In terms of 0 costs spells we have two main ones that are played. Lion's
Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal. Both are incredibly useful mana generating 
resources but neither are required to win. All that it means is more mana 
is needed post DD to get us going. 

Example:

```
Cantrip in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, BW                  BBB+UUBR    (7)    8 Storm

CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, BW                  BBB+BBR1+X  (7+X)  9+X Storm

CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, ToA                 BBB+B+X     (4+X)  8+X Storm
```

The general concepts to remember is that our main method of mana increase 
is DR. This means we need both B to enable the casting of these rituals
and also R available to cast BW at the end. Alternatively if you are aiming for
a LM pile you need U to help cast him. As all our cantrips are not affected we
can still easliy draw into what we need. 

Alternatively, with enough mana, you can incorporate a piece of anti-hate such as
Chain of Vapor, Void Snare, Hurkyl's Recall, Echoing Truth or similar into the
pile to remove the offending object preventing your casting.

Example:

```
2 x GP in hand:
-> CoV, IU, LP, GP, LM                  BBB+UUU2      (8)      4 life
```


#### 1 Cost spells

This is THE classic opener of stompy variants, aggro loam and other 
strategies that aren't concerned with cantripping or similar. The main issue
with this limitation is getting to the point you can cast Doomsday rather 
than the actual going off. Obviously things like running BW along with artifact
hate such as Meltdown or 


#### 2 Cost spells

#### 4 Cost spells

#### 6 cost spells

## Limitations of Our Mind

As can be see above there are a number of ways we can get through the
limitations presented by our own preferences of deck building and of the
constraints our opponents try to enforce upon us. Side boarding correctly
can help mitigate a lot of these issues by presenting answers to the problems
before we go off. We can also use the tools already in our repertoire such
as discard spells, silence effects and suchlike to limits our opponent's 
ability to interact with us.

The key thing to remember if faced with limitations is to not panic. It
doesn't matter if your LEDs are gone, you have alternatives. The Surgical in 
the opponent's hand? Negligible. That Pyroblast they have ready for your Three
Wishes? Hah! Just remember there is more than one path to victory and to try
not to fall into the trap of despair that comes from rote learning of piles
only to see them become useless in the face of an untimely Revoker or Chalice
on 0.

Keep an opoonent mind, stay cool and always have fun.
