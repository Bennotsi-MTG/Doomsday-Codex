# Sideboarding

One of the most commonly asked questions on the subject of any Legacy
deck is "What should I put in my sideboard?" or "How should I side 
against deck XXX?" People often get annoyed at this question with
fair enough reasons to. It is a very subjective topic and depends entirely
on playstyle, list and local metagame (ie: what decks you expect to face). 
This article will not tell you the way you should sideboard but will instead
discuss how you should approach sideboarding and list some of the options
that people have tried in the past.

A sideboard is available to let us mitigate any weaknesses we have in a given 
match up or to alleviate any pressure from what our opponent might board in
to combat us. We change our deck to alter the speed, resiliency, level of 
aggressiveness and level of protection it gives us. It can also let us 
completely curve ball our opponent and change up how we win entirely.  


## Proactive vs Reactive

We can simplify the number of types of cards we have to sideboard into two broad
catergories; Proactive and Reactive. Proactive cards aim to enact a reaction from 
our opponent whilst Reactive cards are there to combat what our opponent is doing. 
One could argue two things about this ideal. First of all this is all just semantics
and that they all do the same thing. The other is that there is not really any truly
Proactive sideboarding as everything you are doing (even if it is changing your gameplan)
is in reaction to your opponent's deck.

## Autobots Transform!

Ah yes, the transformational sideboard. A classic in terms of blindsiding an unsuspecting 
opponent. The look for horror on your opponent's face as they hold a useless hand of 
Flusterstorms and Spell Pierces as you bash them to death with Monk tokens is always 
priceless. Running a transformational sideboard can be really effective but, conversely, it
can also dilute your deck and often uses a not insigificant number of sideboarding slots
to fit it in.

There have been a number of options for Doomsday to transform into tried over time. I shall 
discuss the main ones I am aware of 

In terms of what you actually board in and out in a certain match up; I am
a poor choice of teacher. I am still learning this art and who's to say I 
will ever master it. Just think through what we are going to discuss and
