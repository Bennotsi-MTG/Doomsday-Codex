# The Doomsday Codex

The Doomsday Codex is intended to be the most complete and up to date work on how to 
cast the card named Doomsday in the Doomsday storm combo deck (DDFT) in the Legacy format of 
Magic: the Gathering.

There is actually much more to how to play the deck, but understanding how to cast the namesake 
card of the deck is a pretty big piece of the puzzle. This document is specifically not a 'primer' as 
you often see for other decks in Legacy, because primers generally become outdated 
rather quickly and are more about card choices, decklists, sideboard plans, and so 
on. The Doomsday Codex is there to help people to really understand how the deck 
works and can win in various scenarios.

An overview of Doomsday piles is actually collected in a separate document, which is 
called [DDFT-PileDoc](https://github.com/Bennotsi-MTG/DDFT-PileDoc). The pile 
document only lists a selection of the possible piles, while the Doomsday Codex 
focusses the theory behind the piles. How to build them, when to build them, why the 
pile is build up like that, how to play around stuff, how to sequence your spells 
correctly, and so on.

Another related collection of articles is the 
[Doomsday-Library](https://github.com/Bennotsi-MTG/Doomsday-Library). This is a 
collection of archived articles that have become obsolete, for example due to the 
format evolving, or because certain cards have been banned.
