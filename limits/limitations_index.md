# Playing with Limitations

"What if our opponent has X?"

This is a series of short-(ish) articles dedicated to the various types of hate
we can expect to face piloting Legacy Doomsday. This list is not exhaustive, nor
is it considered a must follow guide, it is merely to try and help you to no
panic when faced with these things and therefore be able to see the line needed
to take to get around these things.

### Playing with a Chalice of the Void on X

This is a generic title. This section discusses all cards that selectively lock
off a certain CMC cost of a spell. This can include things like Chalice of the
Void, Sanctum Prelate or non-permanent hate such as Spell Snare. There are some
CMC's the deck needs to be able to function, and some that are completely
optional. Here we shall exaplore in ascending numerical order the relevancy
these cards have against us.

For each value examples will be given on what hate you might face and how to get
around the listed limiter.

#### 0 Cost spells

In terms of 0 costs spells we have two main ones that are played. Lion's Eye
Diamond and Lotus Petal. Both are incredibly useful mana generating resources
but neither are required to win. All that it means is more mana is needed post
DD to get us going.

Examples:

```
Cantrip in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, BW                  BBB+UUBR    (7)    8 Storm

CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, BW                  BBB+BBR1+X  (7+X)  9+X Storm

CB in play. Cantrip in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, ToA                 BBB+B+X     (4+X)  8+X Storm
```

The general concept to remember is that our main method of mana increase is DR.
This means we need both B to enable the casting of these rituals and also R
available to cast BW at the end. Alternatively if you are aiming for a LM pile
you need U to help cast him. As all our cantrips are not affected we can still
easliy draw into what we need. If you happen to be playing with maindeck ToA
then you don't need to worry about these additional colour requirements but for
most DDFT lists you do.

Further Examples:

```
GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, BW                  BBB+UUBR  (7)  8 Storm

GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, GP, CB, LM                  BBB+UUUB  (7)  2 Life

GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, ToA                 BBB+UUB   (6)  7 Storm

```

#### 1 Cost spells

This is THE classic opener of stompy variants, aggro loam and other strategies
that aren't concerned with cantripping or similar. The main issue with this
limitation is getting to the point you can cast Doomsday rather than the actual
going off. Obviously things like running BW along with artifact hate such as
Meltdown can help get around the issue but you may just find you can go off
without it (however unlikely that may be).

The two main points to take is the lack of ability to cast your cantrips and the
lack of being able to cast things like DR or CB. IC is the preferred draw method
here as it means you get the complete stack rather than IU that leaves you
eneding to draw an additional card. If you have a CB in play already then there
is obviously no issue but it is still worth considering.

With these piles you also have to consider you have most likely cast DD off of
lands and LPs. As a result you probably have less mana available therefore pass
the turn piles are a strong consideration.

Example:

```
Pass the turn.
-> BW (IC), LED, LED, LP, BW          BBB+2R   (7)  7 Storm
```

#### 2 Cost spells

This is less likely to be faced in terms of Chalice of the Void but significant
in that it includes playing around Spell Snare, a semi common card in many Ux
decks. The main things that get cut from this is IU and BW. Ideally this means
if you are running TW/AoI you should have no issues generating a simple double
cantrip LM pile however if you require a BW storm kill then you have to get rid
of it. You can also ignore the limitation with maindeck ToA.

As you can see this is already a fairly straightforwards limitation to get
around so I won't include any examples for it.

#### 3+ Cost spells

Congratulations to whomever has cast their Chalice on 4 or more however that is
more than likely not what has happened. Instead it's probably a Sanctum Prelate
or Gaddock Teeg on the opposing battlefield. Prelate is a little more tricky as
that can lock off your 3 spells (DD, AoI, TW, IC) which can make going off with
our namesake spell difficult but not impossible. Thankfully Prelate is a 3 drop
itself and therefore a little bit slower to come down.

Teeg is both an easier to set down threat (2 drop and can be got with Green
Sun's Zenith) however it is also easier to play around. It only really stops two
spells commonly run; TS and ToA. Simply put; just make a basic LM pile and you
should be able to win. If not, then removal will have to come into play.

### Playing against Revoker naming X

This is a play that you often find versus MUD or Death and Taxes. Unlike Pithing
Needle, Revoker shuts down Lion's Eye Diamond and / or Lotus Petal. One updside
compared to say, Chalice on 0, is that you can still cast the named cards
allowing generation of storm. You can also get rid of them through both artifact
and creature removal. If not, you can also follow the same tips for Chalice on 0
mentioned above.

### Playing against Red Blasts

Any deck playing Red will likely bring in at least one Red Elemental Blast or
Pyroblast against you. It hits cantrips and therefore has a high number of
targets. The main trick to getting around these is just not play Blue spells
(duh). Using BW into AoI/IC or CB to draw into your pilewill negate the R blast
into nothing but a R: +1 Storm effect.

Example:

```
BW (IC) in hand:
-> CB, LED, LED, LP, BW (ToA)          BBB+1BBBR   (8)  8 Storm
```

### Playing against Thalia and other Sphere effects

These are a real headache.

### Playing against Chains of Mephitospholes

This example of a hate card is pretty narrow but very brutal. Expect this from
decks like Jund variants or Pox-esque decks. The main trick to this is to limit
how many times the words "Draw a card" are used. Luckily AoI/TW both avoid this
terminology therefore making them perfect for getting around the issue. You
likely will need at least one draw effect though so make sure to have an excess
card available to bin to enabling the draw.

Example:

```
BW (AoI)+GP+1 Card in hand:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW, X                BBB+1R   (5)  9 Storm
```

If you do have to use IU or similar, you should be fine so long as you have
enough 'dead' cards available to discard.

## Limitations of Our Mind

As can be see above there are a number of ways we can get through the
limitations presented by our own preferences of deck building and of the
constraints our opponents try to enforce upon us. Side boarding correctly can
help mitigate a lot of these issues by presenting answers to the problems before
we go off. We can also use the tools already in our repertoire such as discard
spells, silence effects and suchlike to limits our opponent's ability to
interact with us.

The key thing to remember if faced with limitations is to not panic. It doesn't
matter if your LEDs are gone, you have alternatives. The Surgical in the
opponent's hand? Negligible. That Pyroblast they have ready for your Three
Wishes? Hah! Just remember there is more than one path to victory and to try not
to fall into the trap of despair that comes from rote learning of piles only to
see them become useless in the face of an untimely Revoker or Chalice on 0.

Keep an open mind, stay cool and always have fun.
