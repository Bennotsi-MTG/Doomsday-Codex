# Card Draw Limitations

There are a few cards that fall under this limitation and these
are all cards that prey on the blue cantrip shell. The purpose
of opponent's running these cards is to stop the filtering and card
advantage presented by cards such as Brainstorm and thus shut off a
large part of the combo selection/'turbo xerox' decks' strategies.
The list of these most commonly played examples currently are:  

- Leovold, Emmissary of Trest  
- Spirit of the Labyrinth  
- Chains of Mephistopheles  

The primary issue with playing around or against these cards is not being
able to draw into your Doomsday stack. Thankfully we do have at least one
pair of cards suited for playing around these: AoI/TW. Both of these give
an exile clause over a draw clause letting you dig at least three cards into
your pile however this won't let you get to every card in the stack. Having an
AoI in your SB in addition to an exile three effect maindeck will allow you to
complete a relatively easy stack:  

Example:  

```
BW in hand, AoI in SB.
-> AoI, LED, LED, LED, BW                                BBB+3RR   (8)   9 Storm.
```

One nice thing about the limitation cards here is that they cannot prevent you drawing
your card for turn. This means pass the turn piles are still very viable however they
do open you up to delays and a loss of potential resources as, for example, you cannot 
activate a draw immediately with LM or loop storm count up using CB. For Leovold and Spirit,
you can do a LM pile with a CB in play and activate it on their turn for the win should you
be concerned but it unfortunately does let them untap presenting a risk for opening yourself
up to removal. Here you can in fact get around Chains a bit easier as it will allow you to dig
an extra card deeper:  


Example:  

```
GP + 1 card in hand.
-> X, AoI, LED, LM, CB                                 BBB+3R   (6)
```

In the above example you cast Doomsday, cast GP
