# Card Draw Limitations

There are a few cards that fall under this limitation and these
are all cards that prey on the blue cantrip shell. The purpose
of opponent's running these cards is to stop the filtering and card
advantage presented by cards such as Brainstorm and thus shut off a
large part of the combo selection/'turbo xerox' decks' strategies.
The list of these most commonly played examples currently are:  

- Leovold, Emmissary of Trest  
- Spirit of the Labyrinth  
- Chains of Mephistopheles
