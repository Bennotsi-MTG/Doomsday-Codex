### Playing with a Chalice of the Void on X

This is a generic title. This section discusses all cards that selectively
lock off a certain CMC cost of a spell. This can include things like Chalice
of the Void, Sanctum Prelate or non-permanent hate such as Spell Snare.
There are some CMC's the deck needs to be able to function, and some that 
are completely optional. Here we shall exaplore in ascending numerical order
the relevancy these cards have against us and some strategies to face them.

For each value examples will be given on what hate you might face and how to 
get around the listed limitation.

In addition to these 'work around' piles, we'll also discuss the catch all
requirements for removing these restrictive permanents. As some numbers being
named restrict certain removal cards, it's good to have at least two available
to allow yourself an out for these card if you were to face them.

## 0 Cost spells

In terms of 0 costs spells we have two main ones that are played. Lion's
Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal. Both are incredibly useful mana generating 
resources but neither are required to win. All that it means is more mana 
is needed post DD to get us going. 

Examples:

```
GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, BW                  BBB+UUBR    (7)    8 Storm

CB in play. GP in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, ToA                 BBB+BB+X    (4+X)  8+X Storm

GP and GP in hand:
->DR, AoI, DR, DR, BW                  BBB+BRR    (6)     8 Storm

GP and GP in hand:
->DR, AoI, DR, LM, GP                  BBB+UBR    (6)     
```

The general concept to remember is that our main method of fast mana generation 
after our 0 cost artifacts is DR. This means we need both B to enable the casting
of these rituals and also R available to cast BW at the end. Alternatively if you
are aiming for a LM pile you need U to help cast him. As all our cantrips are not 
affected we can still easliy draw into what we need. If you happen to be playing with maindeck
ToA then you don't need to worry about these additional colour requirements but
for most DDFT lists you do.

CMC 0 basically only stops Engineered Explosives in terms of cards we can bring in
to fight it. Anything else such as By Force, Hurkyl's Recall or similar can all deal
with a chalice on 0 with no issue and similarly, Massacre, Abrupt Decay, Pyroclasm
can all easily deal with Sanctum Prelate. One thing to note is, should you by some means
have a way to generate colourless mana, you can in fact play EE on '1' and it resolve with
0 counters on due to the nature of Sunburst only counting coloured mana.  

## 1 Cost spells

This is THE classic opener of stompy variants, aggro loam and other 
strategies that aren't concerned with cantripping or similar. The main issue
with this limitation is getting to the point you can cast Doomsday rather 
than the actual going off. Obviously things like running BW along with artifact
hate such as Meltdown can help get around the issue but you may just find you can
go off without it (however unlikely that may be). You can also just try to go for an
EtW play by throwing cantrips like GP into Chalice then using lands, LP and LEDs to BW
for EtW. This can also achieve a natural ToA kill if you have the time and resource.

The two main points to take is the lack of ability to cast your cantrips and the 
lack of being able to cast things like DR or CB. IC is the preferred draw method here
as it means you get the complete stack rather than IU that leaves you eneding to draw 
an additional card. If you have a CB in play already then there is obviously no issue 
but it is still worth considering. This is also where the Cycling ability of Edge of 
Autumn shines as it represents a cantrip that, although does not generate storm, does
allow drawing into the pile and also drawing a card for LM victories.

With these piles you also have to consider you have most likely cast DD off of lands
and LPs. As a result you probably have less mana available and as the most common method
of entering into our stacks are one mana cantrips, pass the turn piles are a strong
consideration. If passing the turn is not an option then wishing for a draw spell, using
a draw spell already in hand or using something like Edge of Autumn to access the pile are
all considerations.

Examples:

```
Pass the turn:
-> BW (IC), LED, LED, LP, BW          BBB+2R   (7)  7 Storm

BW(AoI) in hand, CB in play, Pass the Turn:
-> LED, LED, LED, AoI, BW             1R       (2)  9 Storm

BW(IC) in hand, CB in play:
-> LED, LED, LP, LP, BW               BBB+2R   (6)  9 Storm

BW(EoA) in hand, CB in play:
-> LED, AoI, LED, LED, BW             BBB+1R   (5)  8 Storm
```

In terms of removal there is very little actually limited here. Only Chain of Vapor
or Void Snare are affected here. This is where By Force shines over some other artifact
removal as casting By Force with X = 1 means that it becomes a CMC 2 card that then allows
you to destroy a single Chalice set to 1. A Sanctum Prelate is equally vulnerable as most of
our removal for creatures costs 2 or 4.

## 2 Cost spells

This is less likely to be faced in terms of Chalice of the Void but significant in that
it includes playing around Spell Snare, a semi common card in many Ux decks. The main things
that get cut from this is IU and BW. Ideally this means if you are running TW/AoI you
should have no issues generating a simple double cantrip LM pile however if you require a BW
storm kill then you have to get rid of it. You can also ignore this limitation with maindeck
ToA.

Examples:

```
GP in hand, CB in play:
-> LED, AoI, ToA, LED, CB              BBB+0+X   (3+X)  9+X Storm

GP in hand:
-> AoI, LED, BS, Lm, X                 BBB+2UR   (7)     
```

This limitation in terms of removal is very awkward. Things like Abrupt Decay are not affected from
a Chalice set to 2 as it ignores the 'Counter that Spell' clause. This does lock off things like 
Hurkyl's Recall or Echoing Truth though but allows Void Snare and Chain of Vapor to be used. 
What is harder to remove is a Sanctum prelate set on 2. This prevents BW from finding a Massacre
and prevents the casting of Abrupt Decay or things like Pyroclasm.

## 3 Cost spells

This is an interesting one to deal with. At this point it is almost guaranteed this is a Sanctum
Prelate rather than a Chalice as very rarely do decks dump six mana into stopping 3 cost spells.
(Especially as such decks normally run plenty themselves). The main cards blocked here are of course
Doomsday itself, and some of our enablers (AoI, TW and IC). If you are running IU then this does
not prevent your main PTT piles should this limit come down once you have committed. If facing this
limit you still have access to everything you need to find answers and if in doubt, you can still
initiate an Empty the Warrens line with no issue.

Removal wise this does not prevent anything really unless you are going for something more spicy
such as Toxic Deluge or Rushing River. Otherwise all your removal is turned on and ready to go.

## 4 Cost spells

In this category we introduce, in addition to Prelate and Chalice, Gaddock Teeg
as another limitation permanent we could face. The main thing here is that this
number block prevents our Storm finishers from being used. LM piles are 
completely unaffected so those are an easy line to victory. 

Also to consider is the fact that we don't need to worry too much about Chalice 
being set to four. Storm will still trigger so only the original instance of the
spell will be stopped. You do have to mindful that this does not trip you up.
It does still prevent the use of Massacre though in case it should be needed. 

Removing these two is also tricky at this cost block as it turns off our primary 
W removal in the form of Massacre. Other means of removal, if a LM pile is not
available, need to be considered.  

Teeg also shuts off the use of By Force in the instance that he is used in Tandem with 
Chalice or Similar (think Aggro Loam) so this could advocate the use of other removal.



## Summary

1. There is always a winning line available  
2. Strong sideboarding is key to mitigating these issues  
3. Variable CMCs for your removal is advised
