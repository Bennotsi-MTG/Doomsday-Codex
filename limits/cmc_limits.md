### Playing with a Chalice of the Void on X

This is a generic title. This section discusses all cards that selectively
lock off a certain CMC cost of a spell. This can include things like Chalice
of the Void, Sanctum Prelate or non-permanent hate such as Spell Snare.
There are some CMC's the deck needs to be able to function, and some that 
are completely optional. Here we shall exaplore in ascending numerical order
the relevancy these cards have against us and some strategies to face them.

For each value examples will be given on what hate you might face and how to 
get around the listed limitation.

In addition to these 'work around' piles, we'll also discuss the catch all
requirements for removing these restrictive permanents. As some numbers being
named restrict certain removal cards, it's good to have at least two available
to allow yourself an out for these card if you were to face them.

## 0 Cost spells

In terms of 0 costs spells we have two main ones that are played. Lion's
Eye Diamond and Lotus Petal. Both are incredibly useful mana generating 
resources but neither are required to win. All that it means is more mana 
is needed post DD to get us going. 

Examples:

```
GP in hand:
-> IU, DR, DR, GP, BW                  BBB+UUBR    (7)    8 Storm

CB in play. GP in hand:
-> DR, IC, DR, CB, ToA                 BBB+BB+X    (4+X)  8+X Storm

GP and GP in hand:
->DR, AoI, DR, DR, BW                  BBB+BRR    (6)     8 Storm

GP and GP in hand:
->DR, AoI, DR, LM, GP                  BBB+UBR    (6)     
```

The general concept to remember is that our main method of fast mana generation 
after our 0 cost artifacts is DR. This means we need both B to enable the casting
of these rituals and also R available to cast BW at the end. Alternatively if you
are aiming for a LM pile you need U to help cast him. As all our cantrips are not 
affected we can still easliy draw into what we need. If you happen to be playing with maindeck
ToA then you don't need to worry about these additional colour requirements but
for most DDFT lists you do.

CMC 0 basically only stops Engineered Explosives in terms of cards we can bring in
to fight it. Anything else such as By Force, Hurkyl's Recall or similar can all deal
with a chalice on 0 with no issue and similarly, Massacre, Abrupt Decay, Pyroclasm
can all easily deal with Sanctum Prelate.

## 1 Cost spells

This is THE classic opener of stompy variants, aggro loam and other 
strategies that aren't concerned with cantripping or similar. The main issue
with this limitation is getting to the point you can cast Doomsday rather 
than the actual going off. Obviously things like running BW along with artifact
hate such as Meltdown can help get around the issue but you may just find you can
go off without it (however unlikely that may be). You can also just try to go for an
EtW play by throwing cantrips like GP into Chalice then using lands, LP and LEDs to BW
for EtW. This can also achieve a natural ToA kill if you have the time and resource.

The two main points to take is the lack of ability to cast your cantrips and the 
lack of being able to cast things like DR or CB. IC is the preferred draw method here
as it means you get the complete stack rather than IU that leaves you eneding to draw 
an additional card. If you have a CB in play already then there is obviously no issue 
but it is still worth considering. 

With these piles you also have to consider you have most likely cast DD off of lands
and LPs. As a result you probably have less mana available therefore pass the turn piles
are a strong consideration.

Example:

```
Pass the turn:
-> BW (IC), LED, LED, LP, BW          BBB+2R   (7)  7 Storm

BW(AoI) in hand, CB in play, Pass the Turn:
-> LED, LED, LED, AoI, BW             1R       (2)  9 Storm

BW(IC) in hand, CB in play:
-> LED, LED, LP, LP, BW               BBB+2R   (6)  9 Storm
```

In terms of removal there is very little actually limited here. Only Chain of Vapor
or Void Snare are affected here. This is where By Force shines over some other artifact
removal as casting By Force with X = 1 means that it becomes a CMC 2 card that then allows
you to destroy a single Chalice set to 1.

## 2 Cost spells

This is less likely to be faced in terms of Chalice of the Void but significant in that
it includes playing around Spell Snare, a semi common card in many Ux decks. The main things
that get cut from this is IU and BW. Ideally this means if you are running TW/AoI you
should have no issues generating a simple double cantrip LM pile however if you require a BW
storm kill then you have to get rid of it. You can also ignore the limitation with maindeck
ToA.

As you can see this is already a fairly straightforwards limitation to get around so I won't
include any examples for it.

## 3 Cost spells

Congratulations to whomever has cast their Chalice on 4 or more however that is more than
likely not what has happened. Instead it's probably a Sanctum Prelate on 
the opposing battlefield. Prelate is a little more tricky as that can lock off your 3 spells
(DD, AoI, TW, IC) which can make going off with our namesake spell difficult but not impossible. 
Thankfully Prelate is a 3 drop itself and therefore a little bit slower to come down. 

## 4 Cost spells

In this category we introduce, in addition to Prelate and Chalice, Gaddock Teeg
as another limitation permanent we could face. The main thing here is that this
number block prevents our Storm finishers from being used. Labmaniac piles are 
completely unaffected so those are an easy line to victory. 
Also to consider is the fact that we don't need to worry too much about Chalice 
being set to four. Storm will still trigger so only the original instance of the
spell will be stopped. You do have to mindful that this does not trip you up.

Removing these two is also tricky at this cost block as it turns off our primary 
W removal in the form of Massacre. Other means of removal, if a LM pile is not
available, need to be considered.  



## Summary

1. There is always a winning line available  
2. Strong sideboarding is key to mitigating these issues  
3. Variable CMCs for your removal is advised
