# Playing atround artifact/permanent removal

We use artifacts at multiple stages when executing Doomsday piles.
Instant-speed artifact destruction effects therefore have several points 
in the spell chain at which they could disrupt our plan. However, in 
many situations using some additional resources and careful sequencing 
when casting spells, we may create Doomsday piles that are immune or 
robust to artifact destruction. 

Remember that when executing piles that require a CB in play there is a window 
for your opponent to remove it when casting LEDs or cantrips. A lot of the 
time you can set it so this is a negligible issue and you can just activate the
CB in response however for things like Krosan Grip with split second you have 
no option to. What you might hope for, is that your opponent targets Lion's Eye 
Diamond and doesn't realize that split second doesn't work with mana 
abilities (or the fact that LED's ability actually is a mana ability). 
This also means that you shouldn't sacrifice your LEDs in response to 
casting CB when you know your opponent is holding Krosan Grip, but 
instead give your opponent the opportunity to make a mistake.

## Basic Doomsday piles and artifact destruction

Let's start with considering the effect of artifact destruction on a 
couple of simple piles. You have SDT in play, 1UU available, and cast 
Doomsday building -> IU, LED, GP, LED, BW. The execution of this pile is 
of course well-known, but when playing around artifact destruction the 
order in which you cast your spells becomes very important. Also, to 
help the discussion we count every time priority is passed.
1. cast Doomsday
2. tap SDT to draw IU
3. cast IU to draw SDT, LED, GP
4. cast SDT
5. cast LED
6. cast GP to draw LED
7. cast LED
8. tap SDT to draw BW
9. cast BW
10. cast ToA

Your opponent holding an Abrupt Decay has several opportunities to 
interact, but he has to pick the right moment to successfully disrupt 
you. First, at 1 your opponent may cast AD in response to Doomsday. This 
is quite problematic as drawing a card in response won't save your SDT 
from being exiled by Doomsday. There isn't much you can do about this 
once you've reached this point. It's better to not have SDT in play at 
all when you cast Doomsday. If you have SDT in play at the start of your 
turn, it is best to use it to draw a card in your upkeep and then draw 
SDT in your draw step before casting DD. You require 1 extra mana to 
replay it after DD and it may still be destroyed in your upkeep, but you 
will draw an extra card and this is far less problematic than having 
your SDT destroyed somewhere halfway executing your pile. In the rest of 
this writing I will assume you had the SDT in hand when you cast 
Doomsday.

The second opportunity for your opponent is at 2, where your SDT may be 
destroyed when you try to draw IU. This is less of a problem because we 
have GP in our pile. You will still get to draw IU and then cast it to 
draw 2 LEDs and GP. Simply cast both LEDs sac them in response to GP to 
play out the rest of your pile for only 1 less storm then when you 
would've replayed SDT after IU.

Third, at 5 when you cast LED your SDT may be destroyed. In response tap 
it to draw the 2nd LED. Cast both LEDs and use GP to draw SDT for 1 mana 
more than usual replay SDT, sac both LEDs draw BW and win. Note that the 
order in which you play your spells after drawing with Ideas Unbound is 
very important, this doesn't play out as nicely when you play LED or GP 
first.

Fourth, at 6 when you cast GP to draw the 2nd LED your SDT or LED may be 
destroyed. Now SDT can be saved in similar fashion as with the third 
scenario. Note that GP will draw the SDT rather than the LED in this 
case. LED may be just sacrificed in response without any harm as your 
hand is empty.

Fifth, at 7 when you cast the 2nd LED and have SDT and possibly LED in 
play. LED can be sacrificed since your hand is empty. SDT can be saved, 
but you will draw BW. Therefore you have to sacrifice the first LED for 
RRR in response if you had not done so already. The LED currently on the 
stack can be sacrificed later for BBB in response to BW.

Those are the five main points of interaction for artifact destruction. 
To summarize, with 1 mana extra you can play around any single piece of 
artifact destruction as long as your SDT is not in play when you cast 
DD. If you have SDT in play use it to draw a card in your upkeep and if 
your SDT survives you need only 2 mana more than usual to win through 
artifact destruction.

Now let's take a look at the basic pile with a single cantrip. Let's say 
we have GP in hand, UU in pool, cast Doomsday building -> IU, LED, GP, 
LED, BW. You know how this plays out. Now there is only one window where 
your opponent can interact successfully. That is when you cast the 2nd 
LED with the first LED on the table and GP in hand. This is where you 
can't sacrifice it in response without losing the cards in your hand 
(GP). There are no other possibilities for your opponent to interact but 
it is also unlikely that your opponent will miss this opportunity, since 
it's the first time he gets priority with you having an artifact in 
play. When you can produce 1 more black mana you may replace either LED 
with a Dark Ritual or Rain of Filth and solve this issue.

Let's consider the SDT + GP pile that wins for BBB by building:  
``-> LED, IU, LED, LED, BW.``  
Again casting Doomsday with SDT in play is problematic, avoid this at 
all cost. After Doomsday you first cast GP to draw LED and cast it. Then 
cast SDT sacrificing LED in response. However if you tap SDT to draw IU 
you might be in trouble. If SDT gets destroyed you draw IU but casting 
IU will draw you 2 LEDs and BW. If you have one additional red mana 
that's great, but that won't happen to often so this means you are most 
likely in big trouble. If your SDT is not destroyed you have SDT + 2 
LEDs in hand. This also means it will be very hard to play around 
artifact destruction, only if you have an additional 1R available you 
can rescue SDT by drawing BW before you've sacrificed any of the LEDs. 
Its easier if you have B and replace one LED by Dark Ritual, but then 
again if your SDT is destroyed when you tap it to draw IU you still have 
a problem as it should have been a red mana. If you can keep a Lotus 
Petal in play, that could solve the color problem. But it's probably 
better to look for a more generic solution.

A more generic way is solve this solve these colored mana issues is to 
build a different pile. We can replace one of the LEDs by a Lotus Petal. 
Now the only problem is that the mana cost compared to a normal win is 
increased by 2 generic mana. Starting from SDT and GP in hand, build:

```
-> LED, IU, LED, LP, BW BBB+3 (5) 9 or 10 Storm
```
Cast DD, GP, LED, SDT, sac LED in response, tap SDT to draw IU. Either 
your SDT is destroyed now or it isn't. If so, you draw LED, LP, BW and 
still have 2U floating. If not, you draw SDT, LED, LP, in which case you 
cast LP and crack it for R, having 2R floating, cast LED, cast SDT, 
sacrifice LED in resp. for BBB, use SDT to draw BW and wish for ToA.

Double cantrip piles are similar to last pile and are fortunately immune 
to artifact destruction. Consider 2 GP in hand, BBB+1 mana in pool, cast 
Doomsday building -> LED, IU, LED, LP, BW. GP draws LED, cast LED, cast 
GP, sac LED in response, draw IU, cast IU, draw LED, LP and BW, cast LP 
sacrifice it for R. Cast LED and BW, sac LED in response for BBB, use 
the 1 mana in pool to cast ToA. Note that in this execution your 
opponent never gets priority while you have artifacts in play.

## Boarding in Tendrils of Agony to fight artifact destruction

You sometimes see 2 Tendrils of Agony in the sideboards of Doomsday 
decks. There are many different reasons to board in one of the two 
Tendrils. The most commonly used one is probably to still have an out 
when your opponent plans to play Surgical Extraction on Burning Wish. 
Other than that the Tendrils is used to lower the cost of using Chain of 
Vapor or Slaughter Pact inside Doomsday piles.

I would like to add to this list that Tendrils of Agony also has uses 
against artifact destruction. In the current state of Legacy this 
probably won't influence your sideboard plans. As decks that play Abrupt 
Decay usually also play discard spells and you were probably boarding in 
the Tendrils already, because of them having access to Surgical 
Extraction. The same is true for decks playing Qasali Pridemage, from 
which you can also expect to see some Gaddock Teeg postboard.

With 1 of the Tendrils boarded in you can do the following for the basic 
SDT pile:
```
SDT in hand:
-> IU, LED, GP, LP, ToA BBB+2UU (6) 7/8 Storm
```
This pile has the same cost requirements of a normal win with Burning 
Wish, the two mana for Burning Wish is normally produced by a LED in the 
pile. Only because having 2 LEDs in play is problematic, we can change a 
LED for a Lotus Petal and change the Burning Wish for Tendrils to solve 
this issue. The pile produces 7 storm when your opponent destroys your 
SDT when you tap it to draw IU. Since you won't replay the SDT after IU 
you also leave 1 mana unused. If your opponent doesn't do anything you 
make 8 storm.

We can build the same pile and do the same trick for a single cantrip pile:
```
GP in hand:
-> IU, LED, GP, LP, ToA BBB+UU (6) 7 Storm
```
This pile is a bit low on the storm count but is immune to artifact 
destruction for no additional cost.

The more difficult case is the one where we use SDT and a cantrip, 
because we have less space in the pile. You can however build:
```
SDT + GP in hand:
-> LED, IU, LP, DR, ToA BBB+2 (5) 8/9 Storm
```
You play your cantrip to draw LED, play the SDT from hand and use it to 
draw IU. Now SDT is potentially destroyed. If so, IU will draw you LP, 
DR, ToA and you have enough mana to win. If not, you will draw SDT, LP, 
DR and you need 1 generic mana more, to replay SDT and draw Tendrils to 
win.

The double cantrip piles are immune to artifact destruction, whether or 
not you board in ToA. With ToA in however you can build them for just 
BBB and the cost of your cantrips and 1 less storm.

The cost of playing around artifact destruction can be lowered by 
boarding in the Tendrils. But you have to be extra careful to produce 
sufficient storm. An overview for the basic piles and the cost of 
playing around artifact destruction with or without Tendrils is given by 
this table:

| |In hand | Basic Pile   |    Artifact destruction |       ToA boarded in| |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| SDT      | IU,LED,GP,LED,BW  BBB+2UU |     same    +1      | IU,LED,GP,LP,ToA    +0 |
| GP       | IU,LED,GP,LED,BW  BBB+UU  | IU,LED,GP,DR,BW  +B | IU,LED,GP,LP,ToA    +0 |
| SDT + GP | LED,IU,LED,LED,BW BBB+1   | LED,IU,LED,LP,BW +2 | LED,IU,LP,DR,ToA    +1 |
| 2x GP    | LED,IU,LED,LP,BW  BBB+1   | same    +0          | LED,IU,LP,DR,ToA    -1 |

## Playing around a hatebear+artifact destruction

You might wonder what the influence of artifact destruction is on other 
Doomsday piles, and in particular Chain of Vapor piles. CoV piles 
typically involve a moment where you tap SDT and cast CoV in response to 
return it to your hand before drawing a card. If your SDT is destroyed 
in response to your CoV you only get 1 draw, while you require 2 draws 
to play out the pile correctly. This is something that can't be avoided 
and therefore CoV piles are really vulnerable to artifact destruction.

However, the normal kill spell piles are immune to artifact destruction 
because they include a cantrip and use only 1 LED. These piles do 
require that you board in Tendrils of Agony to become anywhere near 
affordable in terms of mana. You can insert the Chain of Vapor in the 
kill spell slot, if you really need to bounce a Leyline of Sanctity or 
Gaddock Teeg or something to win the game.

```
SDT in hand:
-> IU, LED, GP, CoV, ToA BBB+3UUU (9) 7/8 Storm

GP in hand:
-> IU, LED, GP, CoV, ToA BBB+1UUU (9) 7 Storm
```

If SDT is destroyed when you tap it to draw IU, casting IU will draw you 
LED, GP, CoV. In this case you can cast Chain of Vapor on the nonland 
permanent you want to bounce and then use GP+LED to draw and cast 
Tendrils of Agony. If your SDT is not destroyed, IU will let you draw 
SDT, GP, LED, you can cast GP to draw Chain of Vapor and then cast 
LED+SDT to draw and cast Tendrils of Agony. These piles aren't anywhere 
near as efficient as the normal Chain of Vapor piles and generate much 
less storm, but they will allow you to win the game when your opponent 
has both Leyline of Sanctity/Gaddock Teeg and Qasali Pridemage + mana 
open in play.
