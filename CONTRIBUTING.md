# Contribution Guidelines

*Disclaimer: this ought to be a first draft. Edits welcomed and encouraged.*

This document's purpose is to encourage and promote consistency accross all
contributing efforts towards this repository.

## Reporting Issues

Use the [GitHub issue tracker][10].

- Make sure that the issue has not been already reported. Use the search.
- Check that the issue has not been already fixed on `:master`, if you know how
  to.
- Describe as well as you think necessary the issue you are documenting. A
  proper title and/or description save people a lot of time. Use common sense.

## Contributing Contents

### License

See the [LICENSE][20].

### Conventions

There is no true, standard Markdown implementation and different syntaxes might
yield the same result once exported depending on the parser used. However,
having a readable file outside of the HTML export calls for consistency.

Here is a widely accepted [Markdown cheatsheet][30].

Fill your content to 80 columns. This is 2017 and we all have our dual setup of
4K monitors, yet, contributors might prefer to split their editor in several
panels to edit multiple files at once.

### Pull Requests

No need for an issue when you have actual content to contribute.

After you've checked that no pull request was already open on the matter, fork
the repository and submit a pull request for each topic to discuss. Ideally
canonical to avoid confusion during possible merges.

### Commits

The smaller the better. It can be pretty painful to review contributions when
the commits are large and don't treat a single change.

Read [A Note About Git Commit Messages][40].  
In short:

- Use imperative, present tense
- No trailing dot
- Start with a short, capitalized summary, followed by a blank line
- If necessary, add one or more paragraphs separated by a blank line
