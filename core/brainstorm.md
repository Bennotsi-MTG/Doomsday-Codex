# Brainstorm in Doomsday

Brainstorm is one of the most powerful, if not controversial, spells available
in the Legacy format at this time. There have been numerous articles
written on this 'seemingly innocuous at first glance' one mana
cantrip. I will be glossing over the main discussion of this card and
instead focus on the specifics of using it as a part of or to initiate
your doomsday piles. In many cases it can be used as any other cantrip.
If you have say 2UR available post Doomsday then it is perfectly fine to
build a very basic pile to win with.

One of the more difficult things of playing Doomsday storm combo is recognizing
situations where you have the resources to win.
Beginning players often start out with learning only a few piles by heart. While
this helps with getting started, there will be many chances to win that they will miss out on.

The key thing to understand is that Brainstorm can exchange a few cards in your hand
with the top of your Doomsday pile. This enables many new lines of play that will
allow the Doomsday player to win in situations where the basic piles would not.

Let's discuss some examples:

You have U available. You have just cast Doomsday so storm
count = 1. Your hand is BS and BW. Let's assess what we have and look at the
most basic of piles to compare it with:

```
-> [TW/AoI], LED, LED, GP, BW            BBB+U+[1UU/2R] (7)   9 Storm

-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW                  BBB+U+UU (6)         9 Storm
```

As we can see, we now have already available our finishing spell (BW).
This lets us save a slot in the stack to play around with as we can
use the BS to insert the BW from our hand into the pile. As a result,
we have obtained the finisher, we just need to consider mana and a way to
'draw' our cards.

Examples:
```
BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, [TW/AoI], GP, LED, LED          BBB+U (4)             9 Storm

BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, IU, GP, LP, LED                 BBB+1U (5)            9 Storm
```

Example one:   
Storm Count = 1   
1. Cast BS for U (2). Draw LED, (TW/AoI), GP and replace (TW/AoI) and BW   
2. Cast LED (3)   
3. Cast GP (4) and hold priority cracking for UUU or RRR   
4. Draw (TW/AoI)   
5. Cast (TW/AoI) (5)   
6. Exile BW, LED, LED   
7. Cast LED (6)   
8. Cast LED (7)   
9. Crack LEDs for BBB and RRR   
10. Cast BW (8) for ToA  
11. Cast ToA for Storm = 9.   

Thanks to BS we are able to exchange the BW in the pile with another LED. This
concept of swapping can be used for many aspects of piles. In this example it means
we can go off with just U open with any number of the following cards in hand:    

LED, GP, (TW/AoI), BW, LM    

Example two:    
This follows exactly the same as example one however we require an additional 2 generic
to pull it off.   
Storm Count = 1
1. Cast BS for U (2). Draw LED, IU, GP and replace IU and BW   
2. Cast LED (3)   
3. Cast GP (4) and hold priority cracking for UUU   
4. Draw IU   
5. Cast IU (5)   
6. Draw BW, LP, LED   
7. Cast LP (6)   
8. Cast LED (7)   
9. Crack LP for R   
10. Cast BW (8) for ToA, hold priority and crack LED for BBB   
11. Cast ToA for Storm = 9.   

Again the same concept applies however we do need one extra mana. The difference comes
from the fact that we draw BW with IU, as opposed to exiling it with TW or AoI. The fact
that BW is in our hand means that we can not use LED to pay for it. The Lotus Petal in the
pile is used to generate R, which together with the U left floating after IU is enough
to cast BW. LED is sacrificed for black in response to produce black mana, where one
additional generic mana is needed to cast ToA.

Nevertheless both the above examples are cheap piles requiring relatively low resources.  

```
BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, [TW/AoI], GP, LED, LED               BBB+U (4)    9 Storm

BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, IU, GP, LP, LED                      BBB+1U (5)   9 Storm
```

Sometimes, we can get around the IU LED mana restriction simply by having extra cards in
our hands. Notice that in the example above we drew IU only to put it back with
Brainstorm, which is not very useful by itself. If we already had IU in hand, we could
draw any card of our choice from the pile and put back IU. Since we get to put back two
cards, we can put back IU and any other card in hand to effectively use Brainstrom as a
draw-3 spell.

The reason this trick does not work for when we have BW in hand is that we can only put
back two cards with BS, if those cards have to be IU and BW we cannot exchange any
additional cards in hand with cards in the pile.

Say we have BS, IU, and one card in hand. We cast Doomsday and build:
```
BS, IU, X in hand.
-> LED, LED, GP, LED, BW 
```

Storm Count =1   
1. Cast BS for U (2). Draw LED, LED, GP and replace IU and X   
2. Cast LED (3)  
3. Cast LED (4)   
4. Cast GP, hold priority and crack LEDs for UUU, RRR   
5. Draw IU   
6. Cast IU (5) drawing X, LED, BW   
7. Cast LED (6)   
8. Cast BW (7), hold priority and crack LED for BBB, targetting ToA   
9. Cast ToA for Storm = 8. 

Obviously storm can be +1 if you are able to cast X prior to BW. 

Finally let us now consider this scenario;  BS and BW in hand. 1UR available.    
Doomsday has been cast therefore Storm Count =1.   
For argument's sake let us also state that your maindeck draw spell (IU, TW, AoI) 
has been exiled for whatever reasons. We can still work with this scenario.    

Example:   
```
BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, GP, LED, LED, BW               BBB+1UR   (6) 9 Storm
```

Storm Count =1   
1. Cast BS for U (2). Draw LED, GP, LED and replace BW and LED   
2. Cast LED (3)   
3. Cast GP (4), hold priority and crack LED for RRR, draw BW   
4. Cast BW (5) targetting AoI in the SB   
5. Cast AoI (6) exiling LED, LED, BW   
6. Cast LED (7)   
7. Cast LED (8)   
8. Crack LEDs for BBB and RRR   
9. Cast BW (9) targetting ToA   
10. Cast ToA for Storm = 10.  

Again this playline can be followed with two BW in hand, BW and GP in hand or 
other sets of cards.   

## Summary

1. You can use BS to exchange resources between your hand and the pile
2. Don't fixate on specific lines, just remember general rules
