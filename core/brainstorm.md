# Brainstorm in Doomsday   

One of the most powerful, if not controversial spells available
in the Legacy format at this time. There have been numerous articles
written on this 'seemingly innocuous at first glance' one manner 
cantrip. I will be glossing over the main discussion of this card and
instead focus on the specifics of using it as a part of or to initiate
your doomsday piles. It many cases it can be used as any other cantrip.
If you have say 2UR available post Doomsday then it is perfectly fine to 
build a very basic pile to win with.   
One thing that is key to using BS correctly is to use it to recognise 
when you in fact have the resources to win with, just not in the places
you are used to having them. Beginners with the deck will often miss out
on chances to win because they are blindered into only knowing preset
orders of cards and not realising they can convert resources from hand
into the stack.   

Let's discuss some examples:   

You have U available. You have just cast Doomsday so storm
count = 1. Your hand is BS and BW. Let's assess what we have and look at the 
most basic of piles to compare it with:  

```
-> [TW/AoI], LED, LED, GP, BW

-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW
```

As we can see, we now have already available our finishing spell (BW).    
This lets us save a slot in the stack to play around with as we can 
use the BS to insert the BW from our hand into the pile. As a result, 
we have obtained the finisher, we just need to consider mana and a way to
'draw' our cards.

Examples:   
```
BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, [TW/AoI], GP, LED, LED 

BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, IU, GP, LP, LED 
```

Example one:   
Storm Count = 1   
1. Cast BS for U (2). Draw LED, (TW/AoI), GP and replace (TW/AoI) and BW.   
2. Cast LED (3)   
3. Cast GP (4) and hold priority cracking for UUU or RRR   
4. Draw (TW/AoI)   
5. Cast (TW/AoI) (5)   
6. Exile BW, LED, LED   
7. Cast LED (6)   
8. Cast LED (7)   
9. Crack LEDs for BBB and RRR   
10. Cast BW (8) for ToA  
11. Cast ToA for Storm = 9.   

Thanks to BS we have been able to exchange our lack of mana for our finisher. This
concept of swapping can be used for many aspects of piles. In this example it means
we can go off with just U open with any number of the following cards in hand:    

LED, GP, (TW/AoI), BW, LM    

Example two:    
This follows exactly the same as example one however we require an additional 1 generic
available to pull it off.   
Storm Count = 1
1. Cast BS for U (2). Draw LED, IU, GP and replace (TW/AoI) and BW.   
2. Cast LED (3)   
3. Cast GP (4) and hold priority cracking for UUU   
4. Draw IU   
5. Cast IU (5)   
6. Draw BW, LP, LED   
7. Cast LP (6)   
8. Cast LED (7)   
9. Crack LP for R   
10. Cast BW (8) for ToA, hold priority and crack LED for BBB     
11. Cast ToA for Storm = 9.   

Again the same concept applies however we do need one extra mana as otherwise we cannot
cast BW due to our LEDs discard clause.  
Nevertheless both the above examples are cheap piles requiring relatively low resources.  

```
BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, [TW/AoI], GP, LED, LED               BBB+U   (4) 9 Storm

BS, BW in hand.
-> LED, IU, GP, LP, LED                      BBB+1U  (5) 9 Storm
```
