# Cantrips

A staple part of almost any UX deck shell, these delightful
one mana spells allow the player to look through their deck
to help filter their draws and reduce variance as a result of 
the natural laws of entropy... So far the Codex has been tailored
towards learning what to do when casting Doomsday however that is
not the most important (and difficult) part of the deck. The real 
trick to the deck is being able to find and cast Doomsday with the
circumstances you want.

This becomes a fine art and begins right when you select your opening hand.
You need to know your deck in an dout, how many cantrips are you running?
What is the likelihood the next draw is a mana source? Is it better to keep
two bad cards off a Ponder with no shuffle effect for one card gain? From the
point you lock in a starting hand you should have some idea on what your
play lines are going to be. Any interaction from your opponent will affect 
this however you should still try to stick to a plan. 

## Opening hands

Let's jump into some examples. Below I shall present four opening hands 
and would like you to have a quick assessment of them. What is your first turn?
For all four we will assume you and the opponent both kept seven and you are
on the play.

1. USea, LED, DD, CT, GP, P, Island

2. BS, GP, Volc, Pre, P, Dur, CB

3. Delta, BS, BW, DR, DD, LP, GP

4. GP, GP, LP, DR, DD, LED, CB

Let's look at these hands more closely:
