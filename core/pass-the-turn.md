# Pass the Turn piles

First of all, why would you ever want to cast Doomsday and then pass the 
turn? The answer is simple: when you can't win otherwise. Pass the turn 
piles help out when you can't win right now, because you lack mana 
and/or draw effects, but you can't afford to wait much longer either. It 
should be clear that pass the turn piles are practically never a very 
desirable plan. When you make decisions like whether to keep a hand or 
not, or when to cast your cantrips, going for a pass the turn pile 
should serve as a last resort. The risks involved in paying half your 
life rounded up and passing the turn are not to be underestimated.

In Legacy, discard is one of the most common strategies for disrupting 
your opponent's plan. Therefore, many decks try to use discard to prevent 
us from winning the game before they do. One of the main uses of pass 
the turn piles is to become immune to discard. If you can't win right 
now because you still lack some resources, but you can cast Doomsday and 
dump other cards, like Lion's Eye Diamond or Conjurer's Bauble on 
the table, you may be able to setup a win for next turn without giving 
your opponent another window to discard any of your precious cards.

In some other (uncommon) situations building a pass the turn pile may be 
your best shot at winning the game any time soon. For example, when you 
lack a draw effect to draw in to your pile, but have everything else, 
pass the turn piles may be an out. How you managed to end up in this 
situation is a good question, in general, it's not a good idea to keep a 
hand without sufficient filter/draw spells or use your cantrips too 
aggressively and be a left with a Doomsday and no draw effect.

Now that we've made clear that pass the turn piles should basically 
never be part of your plan, but may serve as an out in some situations, 
we are ready to get started:

There is some good reason that you are going for a pass the turn pile 
rather than winning this turn, either you lack resources or you have to 
fight through some form of hate. Let's first talk about building pass 
the turn piles because we lack resources, such as a draw effect or mana. 
We'll focus on playing around/through hate later.

Consider the following (intentionally) bad example:  
You cast Doomsday, but lack a draw effect and therefore build:  
```
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA).  
```
Next turn, for only UU you can draw and cast Ideas Unbound, followed by 
2 Lion's Eye Diamonds and Gitaxian Probe into Burning Wish for Tendrils 
of Agony for 6 storm. Although the mana cost of this procedure is very 
low, the storm count is a bit of a disappointment. Fortunately, it's 
easy to increase the storm count from this point on. If you have 1 more 
mana you can build IU, LED, GP, CB, BW as a pile for 7 storm for 
example. Together with some cards in hand to play out and some 
self-inflicted damage from your opponent's fetchlands, that might just 
be enough.

There are however some more solid ways of reaching winning the game even 
after passing the turn, that still work if passing the turn is primarily 
an anti-discard plan. The ones I will talk about in more detail are 
using Laboratory Maniac, Time Spiral, and a second Doomsday.

## Pass the turn piles with Laboratory Maniac

Laboratory Maniac enables some very mana efficient pass the turn piles 
that may offer an out in situations where no other lethal pile would. 
When you have no other cards in hand or play, for example because you've 
used Lion's Eye Diamond to pay for Doomsday, the simplest pile is:

```
-> IU, CB, LED, GP, LM  1UU (3) 2 life
```

These piles do get a lot cheaper when you have an extra draw effect or 
even LED.

```
LED:
-> GP, IU, CB, DR, LM  B (1) 2 life
-> CB, TW, LED, GP, LM  1 (1) 2 life

GP in hand:
-> LED, IU, CB, DR, LM  B (1) 2 life
-> LED, IU, GP, LP, LM  1 (1) 4 life

CB in play:
-> LED, TW, LED, GP, LM  0 (0) 2 life
```

Instead of using Lion's Eye Diamond to pay for Ideas Unbound/Three Wishes
we can also include some other card into the pile, to for example play
through some card in the opponent's hand. The mana cost for including
another card depends on the location in the pile. There's also a trade-off
between life and mana cost.

```
GP in hand:
-> Silence, IU, LP, GP, LM  W+2UU (5) 4 life
-> LED, IU, Silence, GP, LM  W+2 (3) 4 life

LED:
-> GP, TW, Silence, GP, LM  W+3 (4) 2 life
-> GP, IU, Silence, GP, LM  W+2 (3) 4 life

CB in play:
-> Silence, TW, LED, GP, LM  W+1UU (4) 2 life
-> LED, TW, Silence, GP, LM  W+3 (4) 2 life
```

I've listed Silence because of its distinct mana cost, but you can 
obviously replace the Silence with any other card. Examples are Duress, 
Karakas, or perhaps even a Massacre.

For all pass the turn piles that don't assume a Conjurer's Bauble in play,
you can replace the card that draws from an empty deck in the 
Doomsday pile with Chromatic Sphere and increase the mana cost 
accordingly to play around removal.

## Time Spiral Pass the Turn Piles

The cost listed in square brackets [..] is assumingly payed for by the 
lands are untapped by Time Spiral.

A simple example of a pass the turn pile that uses Time Spiral is as follows:

```
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(TSP), BW(ToA)  UU+1R+[1R] (4) 9 Storm
```

Actually, if you have no other cards in hand or your post-Doomsday 
graveyard resolving Time Spiral will kill you. The Doomsday you've cast 
to build this pile typically ends up as the only card in your graveyard, 
with 5 cards in your pass the turn pile this adds up to 6. However, the 
Burning Wish used to wish for Time Spiral exiles itself, so that's only 
5 cards. That's is why you need at least 2 random cards in your hand or 
post-Doomsday graveyard to not kill yourself. Given that you have 2 
extra cards that you may cast before and after the Time Spiral, as long 
as they don't exile themselves or other cards, you might be able to up 
to storm to well beyond 10. Also note, that the listed cost assumes that 
you can produce 1R with the lands that you untap with Time Spiral.

Executing a Time Spiral pass the turn pile will become much easier if 
you have some extra resources, like a Lion's Eye Diamond or a draw 
effect. If you have both, a pass the turn pile would not be necessary 
unless you're fighting through hate. Considering the following pile:

```
LED in play + 1 card:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(TSP), BW(ToA)  UU+[1] (2) 10 Storm
```

One important advantage of having an LED is that you don't require any 
lands that produce red. Having access to a draw effect rather than a 
Lion's Eye Diamond is unfortunately less effective. Consider the 
following examples:

```
CB in play + 1 card:
-> IU, LED, LED, BW(TSP), BW(ToA)  2UU+[1R] (4) 9 Storm
-> LED, IU, LED, BW(TSP), BW(ToA)  3R+[1R] (4) 9 Storm

-> IU, LED, LED, BW(TSP), BW(ToA)  2UU+[2R] (4) 10 Storm
-> LED, IU, LED, BW(TSP), BW(ToA)  3R+[2R] (4) 10 Storm
```

These piles are actually too mana-inefficient, in these situations it is 
probably better to build a Doomsday pass the turn pile. It is not 
possible to turn additional draw effects into mana, because we don't 
have enough room in the pile and the whole procedure is actually quite 
expensive mana wise: IU=2 + BW=2 + TSP=6 = 10 mana, with another 1R 
post-TSP. As the 2 Burning Wishes and the Ideas Unbound already take up 
3 spots, we only have room for 2 Lion's Eye Diamonds and these can be 
easily drawn by Ideas Unbound, extra draw is not going to help.

This is of course no longer true if you already have Ideas Unbound or 
Burning Wish, as you don't have to include them in the pile. Ideas 
Unbound in hand is not that great as you will be very vulnerable to 
discard. Having a Burning Wish in your hand or post-Doomsday graveyard 
is better. You can use it to wish for Tendrils after Time Spiral, and 
fill up its slot in the pile with another Lion's Eye Diamond. Examples:

```
CB in play + BW in hand or graveyard:
-> LED, TW, LED, LED, BW(TSP)  2+[1R] (2) 13 Storm

CB in play + IU in hand:
-> LED, LED, LED, BW(TSP), BW(ToA)  UU+[1] (2) 11 Storm
```

In summary, Time Spiral pass the turn piles are less specific to what 
cards you need, but you need more (seven) cards in total. You need 2 
cards in hand or post-DD graveyard to not kill yourself with Time 
Spiral, the other 5 are searched with Doomsday. The only pile I usually 
build is IU, LED, LED, BW, BW, unless I have IU or BW already in hand or 
something. Winning on your next turn costs at most 1UUR. The extra 2 
cards that you need can be used to lower the cost of the pile. It's 
important to remember that after casting Time Spiral you need 1R for the 
Burning Wish. Winning with the Time Spiral pile cost 1 more, when your 
lands can't produce red mana. You can crack the 2 LEDs for RRRUUU, so if 
you have 1 spare mana you can float R to ensure you'll be able to cast 
Burning Wish post-Time Spiral.

## Double-Doomsday Pass the Turn Piles

Compared to Time Spiral pass the turn piles, these are more expensive in 
terms of life, but have different requirements in terms of mana and 
cards. You can perform a Time Spiral pass the turn pile with 2 random 
cards if you can produce 4 mana on the next turn. With double-doomsday 
pass the turn piles you should remember that in general you need 1 
specific card and 3 mana. I will leave whether or not we should regard 
this as either less or more expensive up for discussion.

To convert a TSP pass the turn pile into a Doomsday pass the turn pile, 
we replace a Burning Wish in the pile with a Doomsday. The problem is 
that we also need some means of drawing into our second Doomsday pile. 
If you did not have a Sensei's Divining Top in play already, you have to 
replace some card in the pile with a draw effect. Preferably Conjurer's
Bauble or AoI, as it allows us to sacrifice the 2nd LED in response to 
Doomsday and include it in the second pile.  

```
LED in play, PTT:
-> TW/AoI, LED, GP, DD, BW          1UU/2R (3)         9 Storm
-> TW/AoI, LED, LED, BW(ToA), X

LED, CB in play, PTT:
-> IU, LED, GP, BW, BW(DD)          1UUR   (4)         10 Storm
-> IU, LED, LED, GP, BW(ToA)
```

## Pass the Turn CB piles

Conjurer's Bauble can be used to increase storm
despite an apparant lack of card resource. Remember that
when you have a CB in play, one in the graveyard and no cards in your
library you can loop them for the cost of (1) mana.  

```
LED in play, PTT:
-> IC, LED, CB, CB, ToA                  BBB+X (3+X)      9+X Storm
```

In the above example, what looks like a poor setup of only five spells
can be used to enable a greater storm count. In the above example we cast
IC (1) using the mana we used to cast DD the previous turn. We hold priority and
crack LED for BBB. We then draw LED, CB, CB, ToA. We play LED (2) and use BB
to cast both CBs (3,4). We then activate LED for BBB discarding ToA. We activate
our first CB targeting LED, drawing it from our empty deck. We cast LED (5). 
We now have BBBBBBB in our mana pool. We can use this with CB to activate 
CB targeting the CB in the graveyard and loop them playing them again and again
until we only have BBBB in our mana pool. In this base example this is for three 
loops (6,7,8). We can then use the final one to target ToA and cast it for 9 storm.


## Summary   

1. You don't always have to win the turn you cast Doomsday   
2. Pass the turn piles are effective when low on resource (cards or mana)   
3. PTT piles do leave you susceptible to hand attack    
4. There are tricks you can use to ensure you can build up enough storm so you don't always have to rely on LM
