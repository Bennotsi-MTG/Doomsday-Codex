Please find present below the basic setup of how a Doomsday / DDFT decklist
is normally played. As with any Legacy archetype there are a fair few 'flex' slots
that can be changed around however some pieces are pretty fundamental to the
archetype. 

## The Core Elements:

3 x Doomsday

The namesake card. We tend to run three main and relegate one to the sideboard as
a target for Burning Wish thus allowing us to play a pseudo six to seven copies. 
The only change to this number is if you were not playing Burning Wish where you
should be running four. 

4 x Dark Ritual

Doomsday costs BBB. Ritual makes BBB. It's a match made in heaven. This card also 
allows you to pull ahead in mana for firing off discard prior to a Wish for Empty
the Warrens line or similar. You shouldn't ever drop any copies of Ritual. 

4 x Lion's Eye Diamond

A card once known as 'Bad Lotus'. It generates storm, creates mana and is integral to
most of our Doomsday stacks. Should always be a four of. 

4 x Gitaxian Probe

It adds storm, provides a free cantrip effect, let's you check the coast is clear
and is a nasty combo when paired with Cabal Therapy. Should always be a four of. 

4 x Brainstorm

This allows for further deck filtering, hand fixing and some [nifty tricks](http://ddft.wiki/pages-output/ch1/brainstorm/)
involving Doomsday stacks. It also can help protect from opposing discard effects.
Should always be a four of. 

4 x Ponder

Another search and draw filter effect. It has the most reach of any of the cantrips
we run with a potential to see four cards deep. Should always be a four of.
