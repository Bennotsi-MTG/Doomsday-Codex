## Sample games from tournament reports

These snippets from older tournament reports demonstrate a couple of real
situations where Shelldock Isle/Emrakul won the game while playing around or
through hate (They are excerpts from before the banning of Sensei's Divining Top
hence the inclusion of references to it).

Game 2 against a red Godo MUD deck. I open Flooded Strand, Dark Ritual,
Doomsday, Shelldock Isle, Chain of Vapor, Abrupt Decay. So Turn 1 figured I just
go for it as he used his Wastelands quite aggressively game 1, that's why I
boarded in the Shelldock Isle/Emrakul anyway. Flooded Strand fetches Underground
Sea DR->DD building:  
Thoughtseize  
Emrakul  
Island  
Dark Ritual  
Doomsday  
He plays Great Furnace and passes.  
My turn I cast Thoughtseize looking at Blood Moon, Mindbreak Trap (he had it
turn 1), Great Furnace, City of Traitors and Wasteland. So I decide to start the
Jedi Mindtricking :-) While looking at the cards and reading at loud what he has
I simply ignored that the Wasteland might ever be relevant. "A Mindbreak Trap, a
Blood Moon and 3 lands, OK." He puts his Mindbreak Trap in his graveyard, still
assuming I'm going to kill him using storm. Instead I tell him to put the Blood
Moon in his graveyard instead. I drop Shelldock Isle hideaway Emrakul. He
topdecks Blood Moon and gets excited enough to cast it, not realizing that he
should have wasted my Shelldock Isle :-D On my turn I draw my basic Island, use
it to bounce Blood Moon with Chain of Vapor, then use Underground Sea to
activate Shelldock Isle, he's dead.

Game 3 gainst TES. I mulligan twice (no land, no land) to this hand of 5 cards:
Delta, Sea, DR, DD, LED.  
Keeping a 5 on the play without SDT and disruption will probably end up badly
but 4 cards is too low. So I have to carefully optimize my chances. I decide to
play delta->Scrubland DR DD LED go building  
SDT  
Silence  
Shelldock Isle  
Emrakul  
Doomsday (cast with SDT+LED)  
This way I don't fear discard and can realistically combo through one chant,
maybe in resp to his own one play chant + activate shelldock during his turn.
I'm all in and at 9.  
He thinks forever in his turn 1 so I thought I was dead for the first minute but
he finally decides to play Ponder (no shuffle) and then Petal. I play SDT in my
turn. In his turn he does nothing. I look with SDT end of turn to put shelldock
on top and hideaway in my turn. On his turn he plays Chrome Mox imprinting Rite
of Flame. Thinks for a while and then play Silence. I flip SDT and Silence in
resp. On my turn I activate shelldock and cast another DD with SDT+Silence on
top. Take another turn, annihilate his board, and flip SDT to then play Silence
in his upkeep.

Game 3 against Reanimator: It boils down to me resolving a Doomsday for a
shelldock pile featuring Karakas as the 4th card. I can't chant walk him the
turn after, so he's able to reanimate Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite and Griselbrand
while I'm at 8 life or less. I realize that I can't play Shelldock Isle or I
lose so I spin my top and draw Karakas and play it over SI. He draws 7 with
Griselbrand putting him to lethal from one swing of emrakul. I bounce
Griselbrand and go to 4 life from elesh norn and he passes back discarding some
reanimation targets and useless cards. I replay my top, he force's which is fine
by me. I lay down shelldock isle and bounce elesh norn when he attacks with it.
He reanimates 2 dudes. I play a bigger dude that time walks. I win.

Game 3 against UW Counterbalance. We exchange cards and at one point I just have
the mana to play DD with no cards in hand while he fulltapped for Jace, the Mind
Sculptor with Karakas in play. I build  
Sensei's Divining Top  
Shelldock Isle  
Karakas  
Emrakul  
Doomsday  
Because my opponent had Karakas + Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The SDT prevented my
opponent from fatesealing me twice (2nd time is post shelldock). Karakas
destroyed his Karakas. I generally don't put Emrakul next after shelldock in
case they clique another card from my hand. Doomsday allowed me to reshuffle
cards and not die by decking. Attack Jace to avoid the bounce effect on Emrakul.
Attack twice FTW.
