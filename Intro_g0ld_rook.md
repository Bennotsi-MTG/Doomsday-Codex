#Introduction
Every legacy deck is complex, but DDFT is unique in that its process in winning is unlike any other,
as even the decks closely related to this one (ANT, TES) operates, arguably, on a different level of
problem solving. Doomsday has five times the tutoring quantity (not power!) than that of Infernal 
Tutor, and both intend to lead to the same end result, a lethal Tendrils of Agony. The objective 
here is to explain how and when to cast Doomsday, pile construction, and the follow-through sequence
leading to the win.

Doomsday has a number of ways of winning the game, and while each win condition is as important as 
the next, this portion of the wiki is merely introductory and will only cover the Storm aspect. 
Enough spells need to be cast, enough mana needs to be made in order to carry out this plan, the 
Tendrils of Agony with enough Storm triggers. The critical mass of spell count and mana is created 
via engine cards, and for Doomsday’s sister decks, Ad Nauseam and Past in Flames are used to create 
that “card advantage”, so to speak. The goal of the Doomsday pilot is similar. However, instead of 
creating card advantage, Doomsday functions as Vampiric Tutor, five-fold. While it does not replicate 
the raw and efficient (albeit, arguably arbitrary) advantage the way Ad Nauseam and Past in Flames 
provides, a properly set Doomsday pile is enough to end the game on its own. 

That being said, motions leading up to the resolution of Doomsday aside, and the ability to properly 
identify the pile suitable for a given situation is vital to navigating through a game. Much like 
achieving “tetris” in Tetris, there can be no gaps, and any oversights will cost you the game. I’m sure 
you have heard of the infamous “Doomsday Spreadsheet”. I recommend taking a look at it, but advise
against learning it via rote memorization. For the sake of notating piles without having to type out 
card names to excess (Lion’s Eye Diamond, Lion’s Eye Diamond…), the Doomsday community has a long 
standing habit of using acronyms for said cards. If there is one thing to memorize first, it would be 
the table below.

#Pile Building
This section will cover the basic requirements to winning via post-Doomsday, the cards it requires,
mana and storm count. Generally, the pilot must have a way to cantrip into the pile, so the cards 
stacked will depend on what cantrip(s) are available. There are instances where Doomsday will have to 
be cast on its own with no cantrip available. Most of these scenarios may not generate enough Storm 
for a kill, but there are “Pass the Turn Piles” (PTTP), and these will be discussed elsewhere in the 
codex. If it is easier to work through these demonstrations with physical cards, by all means have 
them in front of you. There is a good amount of card manipulation involved.

#Casting Doomsday Itself
This aspect of the deck’s strategy is often overlooked. Meeting the three black pips requirement can 
be tricky in the face of Wasteland, Stifle, and the mere action of playing around these cards. Always
be mindful of this requirement. Do you intend on finding a Dark Ritual? Using Lotus Petals? Pay 
attention to what lands you fetch. In a pinch, Lion’s Eye Diamond can also provide BBB, although this
line, while still possible, has fallen out of favor since the banning of Sensei’s Divining Top. 

#Requirements Post-Doomsday
Once Doomsday has resolved, the next step is to utilize the cards that were tutored for. Most lists 
since April 24, 2017 have used the card Act On Impulse to get through the pile. Conveniently, LED 
provides three mana, and fits perfectly into the mana requirement of AOI. Observe the following sequence:

Ex.1 
‘’’
DR -> DD (LED and GP in hand)
	AoI, LED, LED, GP, BW
Cast LED
Cast GP, holding priority, sacrificing LED for RRR
GP draws AoI, cast AoI
Cast LED, LED
Cast GP, holding priority, sacrificing LEDs for RRRBBB
GP draws BW
BW -> ToA
‘’’

Note that the Gitaxian Probe acted mostly as a space filler. Check this out:
Ex.2
‘’’
DR -> DD (GP and GP in hand)
LED, AoI, LED, LED, BW
Cast GP, drawing LED, cast LED
Cast GP, holding priority, sacrificing LED for RRR
GP draws AoI, cast AoI
Cast LED, LED
Sacrifice LEDs for RRRBBB
Cast BW from exile
BW -> ToA
‘’’
If you are using physical cards, you may have noticed that you just used the same set of cards for
both Ex.1 and Ex.2. These are the typical single-cantrip piles and double-cantrip piles, respectively. 
Familiarize yourself with these patterns, and do note, that the Gitaxian Probes in the demonstrations 
can easily be replaced with other cantrips. Of course, make sure you have the means to pay for them, 
whether it be life or mana, and that if you are using Brainstorm, that the library has three or more 
cards in it.
