# What is the 'CORRECT' play?

Jon Finkel Quote

Scenario:

1. On the play. Opponent leads T1 Verdant, Go. Have option to go off T2 with no Discard. Due to high storm count you have a choice:
A. Hide the LM in your stack
B. Use the spare card to GP to see what they are on

What is the correct play?

Probably the information. [REASONS]

2. Game 2 vs Elves. They have Cradle, Cavern, Wirewood and Quirion Ranger in play. Dryad Arbor and CT in hand. You have an easy
opening for a PTT LM pile. 

You have Tropical, Swamp, LP in play BS in hand post DD. 

What is the correct stack?

You could do an uncomplicated 'basic' one [AoI, LED, LM, GP, GP] but then you could get hit by reclamtion sage.
You could build something to utilise the BS in hand? But with a B source they can CT you.

[Volc, AoI, LM, LED, GP]
Correct is to probably Brainstorm in their turn, leave Volc in hand. This resists  Rec sage and the CT if they were to cast it.
You can then AoI without worry for a R source and win. 

More examples:

T1 on the play vs Flooded Strand.

You have a T1 kill with no protection. Do you jam?
