"Eye of twilight, give us sight.  
Take our offer, give us might.  
Make our power tears of night."  

...   

"Guys do we really want to try and beckon forth power through the Eye of twilight?"  
"Why, what's wrong with the Eye of twilight?"   
"I'm sure there are more powerful entities out there..."  
"Like whom?"   
"The Serpent of fate?"  
"Bit of a stretch, he always requires a sacrifice."  
"We'll just let them take Yelan."  
"Oi!"  
"Sphinx of kr''l?"  
"Too difficult to work out what he's saying."  
"Lord of the unyielding blood?"  
"Never gives up his secrets."  
"Hanarsh the soul taker?"  
"No virgins available."  
"And whose fault is that...?"  
"Enough! Look, Eye of twilight is the best otherworldly entity that may be willing to grant unholy power that we have currently. So he is what we will reach out to. Understand?"  
"Fine."  
"Sure."  
"Okay."  
"Where were we....Eye of twilight, give us sight..."  

...  

"Do we really always have to wear black?"   

## Ritual by Committee, setting the scene

Hello and welcome to the first of what will hopefully be a series
of articles whereby some players get together and either observe and
discuss live games with DDFT or go over scenarios presented by people.
The idea behind this is to try and work through the decision process used
by different people, to help highlight how different people think and to
hopefully provide meaningful examples that give lessons others can take
away and apply to their own play.

In this first ritual meeting we have two members of the super-secret-shadowy-Doomsday-cabal* (TM)
d8dk32 and Doishy playing through some games of an MTGO league.


`*`*super-secret-shadowy-Doomsday-cabal (TM) might not exist....*
Scenario:

1. On the play. Opponent leads T1 Verdant, Go. Have option to go off T2 with no Discard. Due to high storm count you have a choice:
A. Hide the LM in your stack
B. Use the spare card to GP to see what they are on

What is the correct play?

Probably the information. [REASONS]

2. Game 2 vs Elves. They have Cradle, Cavern, Wirewood and Quirion Ranger in play. Dryad Arbor and CT in hand. You have an easy
opening for a PTT LM pile. 

You have Tropical, Swamp, LP in play BS in hand post DD. 

What is the correct stack?

You could do an uncomplicated 'basic' one [AoI, LED, LM, GP, GP] but then you could get hit by reclamtion sage.
You could build something to utilise the BS in hand? But with a B source they can CT you.

[Volc, AoI, LM, LED, GP]
Correct is to probably Brainstorm in their turn, leave Volc in hand. This resists  Rec sage and the CT if they were to cast it.
You can then AoI without worry for a R source and win. 

More examples:

T1 on the play vs Flooded Strand.

You have a T1 kill with no protection. Do you jam?
