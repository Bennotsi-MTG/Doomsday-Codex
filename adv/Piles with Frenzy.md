# Piles with Experimental Frenzy Doomsday - a revitalized version of Doomsday in 2019

*By Knox*

---

Experimental Frenzy is the newest tech for doomsday, creating versatile piles without too much memorization is now possible for newer players- thats not to say that the deck is easy by any means, there are just fewer piles that you need to know to win in a variety of situations due to the insane power of Experimental Frenzy. It has recently been piloted to a top8 finish in the MTGO Legacy Challenge on 4/14/19. 

The deck succeeded in a diverse meta with the London Mulligan, which did not contribute much to 
the result; James reports that he only mulled to 6 once. 

For those who are not familiar with the card, here it is. 

{{!Experimental Frenzy}}

This is the deck James (Ape Of Justice) top8ed the Legacy Challenge on mtgo with on the 14th of April. The London Mulligan may have contributed to the result, but the deck is also just nuts. 

There are similar versions, utilizing a different number of Lim-Dul's Vault basically a Vampiric Tutor x5 with frenzy on board.

## Piles
Piles with DDEFT are much easier than the prior D4, probe, or top versions(In my Opinion).

With Experimental Frenzy in play, casting Doomsday wins the game. 

|{{!LED}}{{!LED}}{{!LED}}{{!DD}}{{!ToA}}|

With this pile, you can get infinite storm.
1. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
2. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
3. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
4. Cast DD, LED LED LED ToA DD
5. Repeat

If you do not have an Experimental Frenzy in play, casting doomsday wins if if you have 3RU and a cantrip. An example of this line- 
### Hand
{{!Brainstorm}}{{!LED}}{{!Dark Ritual|MMQ}}{{!DD}}{{!LP}}{{!Swamp|LEB}}

1. Play Swamp, Lotus Petal, Lion's Eye Diamond S=2
2. Cast Dark Ritual, Cast Doomsday S=4
Your pile is:

{{!Act On Impulse}}{{!LED}}{{!LED}}{{!Preordain}}{{!ToA}}

3. Cast Brainstorm with LP, hold priority and crack LED for RRR- put back both LEDs S=5
4. Cast Act On Impulse, exiling LED LED Preordain. S=6
5. Cast both LEDs, crack for UUUBBB and cast preordain. S=9
6. Draw Tendrils and drain them for 20.

These are probably the most common piles, but there are variations on them. For Example, take this pile-

{{!Experimental Frenzy}}{{!LED}}{{!LED}}{{!DD}}{{!ToA}}

You can use this pile when you have 4 mana sources in play- if you have a Conjurer's Bauble in play, this is a win- if not, this is a PTT pile. 

Example line-

### In Play after Doomsday:  

{{!CB}}{{!Volcanic Island|LEB}}{{!LED}}

1. Crack CB, hold priority and crack LED for RRR. 
2. Draw and play EF. 
3. Make infinite storm, casting DD and making the first Infinite Storm pile using 3 LEDs
4. Drills. 

If your opponent has Phyrexian Revoker on LED or a Chalice of the Void set to 0 and you have a Frenzy in play, you can use this infinite storm pile.

{{!Dark Ritual|MMQ}}{{!Dark Ritual|MMQ}}{{!Dark Ritual|MMQ}}{{!Doomsday|A25}}{{!ToA}}

It does the same thing as the other piles, but it doesnt use LED.

Due to the ammount of mana we will be netting each time we use the stock Infinite Storm pile, we dont actually need 3 LEDs. The pile can be altered to fit in a discard spell or bounce spell post board:

{{!Duress|USG}}{{!LED}}{{!LED}}{{!DD}}{{!ToA}}

**OR**

{{!LED}}{{!Duress|USG}}{{!LED}}{{!DD}}{{!ToA}}

**OR**

{{!Perilous Voyage}}{{!LED}}{{!LED}}{{!DD}}{{!ToA}}

The first option is for when you have black floating, and the second is not. Both generate infinite storm. 

## Collective Brutality - Use Cases

{{!Collective Brutality}}

Collective Brutality is a possible main-deck hedge to cards like Thalia and/or Gaddock Teeg, as well as an alternate win condition in case Tendrils of Agony gets exiled with Surgical Extraction.

## Act On Impulse

{{!Act on Impulse}}

Act on Impulse allows for alternative doomsday piles when you only have 3 mana post DD, and can't cast Experimental Frenzy. 

Using Conjurer's Bauble with Act on Impulse allows for some classic Doomsday piles without Frenzy. 
Conjurer's Bauble allows you to get 6 storm with 5 cards using this pile- 
You need 2RU and a cantrip post doomsday and 3 storm for this to work. 

{{!Act on Impulse}}{{!Tendrils of Agony}}{{!LED}}{{!Conjurer's Bauble}}{{Preordain}}

1. Cast Cantrip, storm 4
2. Cast AOI, no mana floating, storm 5
3. Cast LED, storm 6
4. Crack LED for Blue, cast Conjurer's Bauble, storm 7
5. Crack bauble, putting LED on bottom. 
6. Cast Preordain, drawing LED, storm 8
7. Cast LED, storm 9
8. Crack for BBB, cast ToA storm 10

Sometimes you will not have access to the graveyard, and then you should use this pile:

{{!Act on Impulse}}{{!LED}}{{!LED}}{{Preordain}}{{!Tendrils of Agony}}

This only creates 5 storm, but it can usually get there. 

According to data we have gathered so far, using the Act on Impulse pile occurs around 25% of the time, and should definitely be utilized if possible. 

I have covered most of the basic piles you will need to become proficient with the deck, but of course, there are more small variations to play around different spells and sideboard cards, and those will be in a future article.
