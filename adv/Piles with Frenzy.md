# Piles with Experimental Frenzy Doomsday - a revitalized Doomsday in 2019~

Since the banning of Gitaxian probe on July 2nd of 2018, Doomsday had not seen much action. 
Probe as a free draw spell was integral to the function of the deck as it had existed before the ban, and the deck took a large hit.

Much faith in the deck was lost, and we waited in the wings for a new card to be printed to finally replace the spot of probe-

That card turned out to be Experimental Frenzy.

Experimental Frenzy 3R
Enchantment

You may look at the top card of your library any time.
You may play the top card of your library.
You can’t play cards from your hand.
{3}{R}: Destroy Experimental Frenzy.


James, also known as Ape Of Justice on the Doomsday Discord server, got 6th place in a MTGO challenge on April 14th, 2019 with Experimental Frenzy Doomsday-

We have concluded that a list similar to this is optimal

## Piles
Piles with DDEFT are much easier than the prior D4, probe, or top versions(In my Opinion).

With Experimental Frenzy in play, casting Doomsday wins the game. 

```
EF in play

-> LED, LED, LED, DD, ToA           0 + ∞ Storm
```

With this pile, you can get infinite storm.
1. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
2. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
3. Cast LED, Crack for BBB
4. Cast DD, LED LED LED ToA DD
5. Repeat


This is the most common pile, but there are variations on them as well as the Act on Impulse piles. For Example, take this PTT pile-

```
With 4 mana available on the next turn-

-> EF, LED, LED, DD, ToA            3R + ∞ Storm
```
You can use this pile when you have 4 mana sources in play- if you have a Conjurer's Bauble in play, this is a win- if not, this is a PTT pile. 
    
If your opponent has Phyrexian Revoker on LED or a Chalice of the Void set to 0 and you have a Frenzy in play, you can use this infinite storm pile utilizing Dark Ritual as an alternative to LED

```
EF in Play, B in pool

-> DR, DR, DR, DD, ToA              B + ∞ Storm
```

It does the same thing as the other piles, but it doesn't use LED.

Due to the fact that we only need to be making 4 mana each time we loop doomsday, the pile can be altered to fit in a discard spell or bounce spell-

```
EF in play, B in pool

-> Duress, LED, LED, DD, ToA        B + ∞ Storm
```

**OR**

```
EF in play, 0 in pool

-> LED, Duress, LED, DD, ToA        0 + ∞ Storm
```

**OR**

```
EF in play, 0 in pool

-> LED, ET, LED, DD, ToA            0 + ∞ Storm
```

The first option is for when you have black floating, while the second is not. Both generate infinite storm, and play around different hate pieces.

## Collective Brutality - Use Cases

{{!Collective Brutality}}

Collective Brutality is a possible main-deck hedge to cards like Thalia and/or Gaddock Teeg, as well as an alternate win condition in case Tendrils of Agony gets exiled with Surgical Extraction.

Due to the fact that Collective Brutality makes you gain 2 life, you can loop doomsday, and each time your opponent will be losing 2 life. 

```
EF in play, 0 in pool, Gaddock Teeg in play

-> LED, LED, LED, CoBru, DD         0 + ∞ Storm
```

## Act On Impulse

Act on Impulse allows for more traditional piles when you only have 3 mana post DD, and can't cast Experimental Frenzy. 

Using Conjurer's Bauble with Act on Impulse allows for some classic Doomsday piles without Frenzy. 
Conjurer's Bauble allows you to get 6 storm with 5 cards using this pile- 
You need 2RU, a cantrip, and 3 storm for this to work. 

```
Cantrip in hand and 2RU in pool after DD

-> AOI, ToA, LED, Pre, CB           2RU + 3 Storm
```

4. Crack LED for Blue, cast Conjurer's Bauble, storm 7
5. Crack bauble, putting LED on bottom. 
1. Cast Cantrip, storm 4
2. Cast AOI, no mana floating, storm 5
3. Cast LED, storm 6
6. Cast Preordain, drawing LED, storm 8
7. Cast LED, storm 9
8. Crack for BBB, cast ToA storm 10

Sometimes you will not have access to the graveyard, and then you should use this pile:

```
Cantrip in hand and 2RU in pool after DD

-> AOI, LED, LED, Pre, ToA          2RU + 4 Storm
```

This pile creates 5 storm, which is usually enough. 

According to data we have gathered so far, using the Act on Impulse pile occurs around 25% of the time, and should definitely be utilized if possible. 

I have covered most of the basic piles you will need to become proficient with the deck, but of course, there are more small variations to play around different spells and sideboard cards, and those will be in a future article.
