The interaction between Doomsday and Shelldock Isle surprisingly 
elegant. Once you resolve Doomsday you automatically fulfill the 
otherwise strict condition on Shelldock Isle, but not only are you 
allowed to activate Shelldock Isle, you also get to pick what cards will 
be among the top 4 of your library for Shelldock Isle's Hideaway 
ability. Even better, as Doomsday also allows you to search for 
Shelldock Isle in the first place, it is basically a one-card combo!

## The basics

A very simple example of its use is as follows. Consider your opening 
hand contains Underground Sea, Dark Ritual, Doomsday, you play all three 
and build:
```
-> Shelldock Isle, Emrakul, the Aeons Torn, card 1, card 2, card 3.
```

Next turn you draw Shelldock Isle, play it and hideaway Emrakul. Pass 
the turn. Next turn you untap Shelldock Isle, draw card 1, and cast 
Emrakul. Take 1 extra turn. On your extra turn you draw card 2 and 
attack with Emrakul. Pass the turn again. Untap, draw card 3, attack 
with Emrakul.

As you notice, you get 2 Emrakul attacks before you have to draw a card 
from an empty deck and get to draw 2 cards before your first Emrakul 
attack.

As for the pile you build, it is generally saver to not make Shelldock 
Isle the top card of your pile. Sensei's Divining Top is a much saver 
choice, I myself have lost a game 3 because my opponent attacked with 
Goblin Guide forcing the the Shelldock Isle to go to my hand. This 
reduced the number of cards in my library and left me with only 1 
Emrakul attack. Another reason not to make Shelldock Isle the top card 
is the 'fateseal' ability of Jace, the Mind Sculptor and similar 
effects. Whether Sensei's Divining Top is send to the bottom or not is 
irrelevant, as you will have access to Shelldock Isle either way and 
Sensei's Divining Top replaces itself to your deck, not reducing the 
number of cards. As for your 2 other cards, consider a Dark Ritual and a 
Doomsday to rebuild a library should you need extra Emrakul attacks, or 
include 1 or 2 Dark Rituals and a Tendrils of Agony to some gain life or 
quickly close out the game after 1 Emrakul attack.

The reason that we generally use Shelldock Isle is to hideaway and cast 
an Emrakul, the Aeons Torn. Emrakul is one of the few cards that, once 
cast, gives you a very good shot at winning the game on that card alone. 
Not only will a single blow from the Annihilator 6 paired with 15/15 be 
enough to directly kill or cripple your opponent, but Emrakul is also 
uncounterable. This means that if you manage to resolve Doomsday, all 
other spells you cast for the rest of that game will be uncounterable. 
However, as Emrakul, the Aeons Torn is also frequently played in other 
Legacy decks, cards that may answer Emrakul are also frequently played.

## Playing around hate

Sorcery-speed hate for Emrakul, such as Oblivion Ring or
similar cards as well as the abilities of planeswalkers such as 
Jace, the Mind Sculptor and Liliana of the Veil can be easily played 
around. First of all, this is only relevant if your opponent has more 
than 6 permanents. However, the most elegant solution is to wait with 
activating Shelldock Isle, pass the turn and cast Emrakul in your 
opponent's end step. That way, you first get your extra turn, followed 
directly by your actual turn. This gives you two consecutive turns in 
which you can attack with Emrakul, without ever giving your opponent 
another main phase. Another solution is to attack the planeswalker 
instead of the player, but this may require that you cast another 
Doomsday to refill your library.

The bigger issue is with permanents that may prevent your Emrakul from 
attacking the first place, such as Ensnaring Bridge or Blazing Archon. 
To deal with these you can include a bounce spell in the cards you 
search with Doomsday. This is also the main reason that many Doomsday 
lists used to include a 1-off Wipe Away in the sideboard. Also note that 
we used to play around Karakas, simply by including our own 1-off 
Karakas in the 5 cards you search with Doomsday and play Karakas right 
before casting Emrakul. Unfortunately, this doesn't work anymore because 
the legend rule changed with the M14 rules update. Karakas is currently 
much harder to play around. It will probably cost you another sideboard 
card if you really want it, perhaps Pithing Needle or Wipe Away, but if 
you really want to spend a sideboard slot on this then why not throw in 
an Omniscience? Spending an entire sideboard slot just to make Shelldock 
Isle/Emrakul robust to Karakas is a huge investment though, you'd 
probably only do this if your metagame is filled with UW Counterbalance 
decks with plenty of Karakases in them.

More difficult hate to play around comes in the form of Wasteland and 
Stifle. Stifle is particularly nasty as it can counter not only the 
activation of Shelldock Isle, but more importantly also the Hideaway 
trigger. Similar to Stifle, an opponent may cast Silence or Orim's Chant 
in response to your Shelldock Isle activation, although your ability 
will still resolve you won't be able to cast Emrakul since you're not 
allowed to cast anything for the remainder of the turn. Also, don't 
forget about cards that attack nonbasic lands such as Blood Moon or 
Magus of the Moon, but these can be bounced more easily. Wasteland is 
also very relevant as we are likely to pass the turn with a tapped 
Shelldock Isle in play.

In theory, you might play a card that allows you to untap the Shelldock 
Isle and exploit a window of opportunity when your opponent's Wasteland 
is tapped or hasn't played one yet. Another possible advantage is that 
it may speed up your win by a full turn. Many alternatives for this slot 
have been tested, including Amulet of Vigor, Twiddle, Dream Salvage, and 
so on, but all are inferior to Cloud of Faeries. The conclusion is that 
Cloud of Faeries is better for several reasons:

- It cycles into your pile should you want to kill with Tendrils of Agony after all
- Saves your Emrakul, the Aeons Torn from Diabolic Edict and similar effects
- You need only 1 attack when opponent is on 16 and has no flying creatures
- Cloud of Faeries can block a creature if your opponent has more than 6 permanents

Most people suggesting Amulet of Vigor, think that it will allow them to 
play around Wasteland, but they don't consider that the opponent can 
just as well respond to the Hideaway trigger with Wasteland. Both 
Twiddle and Amulet of Vigor are not cheaper in terms of mana than Cloud 
of Faeries, this should be obvious. You will find that most lists don't 
include any Cloud of Faeries/Twiddle/Amulet to go with the Emrakul plan, 
simply because their use is too narrow. Even if it just takes up 1 
additional sideboard slot is by many players considered not worth it.

Theoretically speaking, we already play a card that can be used to untap 
lands: Time Spiral. However, Shelldock Isle typically removes 2 cards 
(the land goes to the battlefield and exiles the hidden card) from the 
cards that will form your new library before you draw 7. If you don't 
want to kill yourself by drawing 7 cards of Time Spiral, note Time 
Spiral also exiles itself, you need to have 4 cards in your hand or 
post-Doomsday graveyard. And that's not including the cards you will 
draw in the turn(s) that you attack with Emrakul. So this is probably 
not feasible in practice.

## Sample games from tournament reports

These snippets from tournament reports demonstrate a couple of real 
situations where Shelldock Isle/Emrakul won the game while playing 
around or through hate.

[bennotsi 14-01-2013]  
Game 2 against a red Godo MUD deck. I open Flooded Strand, Dark Ritual, Doomsday, Shelldock Isle, Chain of Vapor, Abrupt Decay. So Turn 1 figured I just go for it as he used his Wastelands quite aggressively game 1, that's why I boarded in the Shelldock Isle/Emrakul anyway. Flooded Strand fetches Underground Sea DR->DD building:  
Thoughtseize  
Emrakul  
Island  
Dark Ritual  
Doomsday  
He plays Great Furnace and passes.  
My turn I cast Thoughtseize looking at Blood Moon,
Mindbreak Trap (he had it turn 1), Great Furnace, City of Traitors and Wasteland.
So I decide to start the Jedi Mindtricking :-)
While looking at the cards and reading at loud what he has I simply 
ignored that the Wasteland might ever be relevant. "A Mindbreak Trap, a 
Blood Moon and 3 lands, OK." He puts his Mindbreak Trap in his 
graveyard, still assuming I'm going to kill him using storm. Instead I 
tell him to put the Blood Moon in his graveyard instead. I drop 
Shelldock Isle hideaway Emrakul. He topdecks Blood Moon and gets excited 
enough to cast it, not realizing that he should have wasted my Shelldock 
Isle :-D On my turn I draw my basic Island, use it to bounce Blood Moon 
with Chain of Vapor, then use Underground Sea to activate Shelldock 
Isle, he's dead.

Game 3 gainst TES. I mulligan twice (no land, no land) to this hand of 5 cards:
Delta, Sea, DR, DD, LED.  
Keeping a 5 on the play without SDT and disruption will probably end up badly but 4 cards is too low. So I have to carefully optimize my chances. I decide to play delta->Scrubland DR DD LED go building  
SDT  
Silence  
Shelldock Isle  
Emrakul  
Doomsday (cast with SDT+LED)  
This way I don't fear discard and can realistically combo through one chant, maybe in resp to his own one play chant + activate shelldock during his turn. I'm all in and at 9.  
He thinks forever in his turn 1 so I thought I was dead for the first minute but he finally decides to play Ponder (no shuffle) and then Petal. I play SDT in my turn. In his turn he does nothing. I look with SDT end of turn to put shelldock on top and hideaway in my turn. On his turn he plays Chrome Mox imprinting Rite of Flame. Thinks for a while and then play Silence. I flip SDT and Silence in resp. On my turn I activate shelldock and cast another DD with SDT+Silence on top. Take another turn, annihilate his board, and flip SDT to then play Silence in his upkeep.

[climax 28-05-2012]  
Game 3 against Reanimator: It boils down to me resolving a Doomsday for 
a shelldock pile featuring Karakas as the 4th card. I can't chant walk 
him the turn after, so he's able to reanimate Elesh Norn, Grand Cenobite 
and Griselbrand while I'm at 8 life or less. I realize that I can't play 
Shelldock Isle or I lose so I spin my top and draw Karakas and play it 
over SI. He draws 7 with Griselbrand putting him to lethal from one 
swing of emrakul. I bounce Griselbrand and go to 4 life from elesh norn 
and he passes back discarding some reanimation targets and useless 
cards. I replay my top, he force's which is fine by me. I lay down 
shelldock isle and bounce elesh norn when he attacks with it. He 
reanimates 2 dudes. I play a bigger dude that time walks. I win.

[Lejay 22-05-2012] 
Game 3 against UW Counterbalance. We exchange cards and at one point I just have the mana to play DD with no cards in hand while he fulltapped for Jace, the Mind Sculptor with Karakas in play. I build  
Sensei's Divining Top  
Shelldock Isle  
Karakas  
Emrakul  
Doomsday  
Because my opponent had Karakas + Jace, the Mind Sculptor. The SDT prevented my opponent from fatesealing me twice (2nd time is post shelldock). Karakas destroyed his Karakas. I generally don't put Emrakul next after shelldock in case they clique another card from my hand. Doomsday allowed me to reshuffle cards and not die by decking. Attack Jace to avoid the bounce effect on Emrakul. Attack twice FTW.
